      "options": [
        "Props can only be passed to parent components, never children.",
        "A child component should not mutate a prop directly; it should instead emit an event to ask the parent to change the data.",
        "Data can only flow through a central state manager like Pinia.",
        "Props are automatically synchronized both ways between parent and child."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "This prevents child components from accidentally mutating the parent's state, which would make the data flow hard to understand and debug.",
