      ],
      "correct": [
        1
      ],
      "explanation": "v-if is 'real' conditional rendering because it ensures that event listeners and child components inside the conditional block are properly destroyed and re-created. v-show is much simpler—the element always remains in the DOM.",
      "interviewTip": "Use v-if for conditions that rarely change at runtime; use v-show if you need to toggle something very frequently (like a tab or a tooltip)."

      ],
      "correct": [
        1

      "explanation": "Without keys, Vue uses an algorithm that minimizes element movement and tries to patch/reuse elements in-place. This can lead to bugs with form state or animations.",

      ],
      "explanation": "In Vue 3, v-if has a higher priority than v-for. This means the v-if doesn't have access to variables from the v-for scope, and the code above will likely throw an error because 'item' is not defined when v-if runs.",
      "interviewTip": "In Vue 2, the priority was reversed. Regardless of the version, you should avoid using both on the same element. Wrap the list in a <template v-for> or use a computed property to filter the list beforehand."

        1
      ],
      "explanation": "Filtering with a computed property is the best approach. It's more readable, and because of caching, the filter only runs when the 'users' list actually changes.",
