      "prompt": "What is the primary role of the built-in <Transition> component?",
      "options": [
        "To speed up the frame rate of the entire app.",
        "To automatically apply CSS classes to an element at specific stages of its entering or leaving the DOM.",
        "To convert CSS into JavaScript code.",
        "To prevent the user from clicking buttons during an update."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "<Transition> doesn't animate things itself; it detects when an element is added/removed and adds classes like '-enter-from' and '-enter-active' so your CSS can do the work.",
      "interviewTip": "Mention that <Transition> only works on a single element or component. For lists, you must use <TransitionGroup>."

      "options": ["enter-to", "enter-final", "enter-end", "enter-done"],
      "correct": [0],
      "explanation": "The six transition classes are: enter-from, enter-active, enter-to, leave-from, leave-active, and leave-to.",
      "interviewTip": "If you don't provide a 'name' attribute to the transition, the classes default to 'v-enter-from', etc."

        "Animations are not supported for lists.",
        "Use v-animate on every item."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "<TransitionGroup> renders a real element (default is no element in Vue 3, but can be specified) and handles the movement of items as the list is reordered.",
      "interviewTip": "Items inside a <TransitionGroup> MUST have a unique :key for the animations to work."

      "id": "ta-04",
      "stageId": "transitions_animations",
      "type": "single",
      "prompt": "Analyze the code. What does the 'mode' attribute do?",
      "code": "<Transition name=\"fade\" mode=\"out-in\">\n  <component :is=\"activeComponent\" />\n</Transition>",
      "options": [
        "It makes the animation run twice.",
        "It ensures the current component finishes its 'leave' animation before the new component starts its 'enter' animation.",
        "It forces the animation to run in the background thread.",
        "It randomizes the transition effect."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "Without 'out-in', both components would be in the DOM at the same time during the transition, often causing layout 'jumping'.",
      "interviewTip": "The 'out-in' mode is almost always preferred for smooth page or component transitions."

    {
      "id": "ta-05",
      "stageId": "transitions_animations",
      "type": "single",

        "Use the 'appear' attribute on the <Transition> component.",

        "Transitions only work on updates, not initial mount.",
        "Call transition.start() in onMounted."
      ],
      "correct": [0],
      "explanation": "The 'appear' attribute tells Vue to apply the enter transition classes as soon as the element is first rendered.",
      "interviewTip": "This is great for 'hero' sections or entrance animations for a landing page."

      "options": ["@before-enter", "@enter", "@after-leave", "@on-animating"],
      "correct": [0, 1, 2],
      "explanation": "Vue provides JS hooks like @before-enter, @enter, and @leave so you can use libraries like GreenSock (GSAP) or Anime.js instead of CSS.",
      "interviewTip": "When using JS hooks, it's best to add :css='false' to tell Vue to skip CSS detection for a performance boost."

      "options": [
        "To allow the user to drag and drop items.",
        "To animate the position change of items when the list is reordered (e.g., via sorting).",

        "To delete the item from the list."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "While enter/leave classes handle appearing/disappearing, 'v-move' (or '[name]-move') uses the FLIP technique to smoothly slide items to their new positions.",
      "interviewTip": "This is how you get those smooth 'shuffling' effects in lists."

        "A Transition can only have one child element at a time.",

        "Both of the above.",
        "Nothing is wrong."
      ],
      "correct": [2],
      "explanation": "A <Transition> only animates a single child. If you have multiple elements toggling, they need unique keys so Vue can track which is which, or you should use a single component with :is.",
      "interviewTip": "Always use unique keys when transitioning between two different elements of the same tag type."
