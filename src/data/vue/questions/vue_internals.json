      ],
      "correct": [
        1
      ],
      "explanation": "During the compilation phase, Vue marks elements with flags. For example, if only the text is dynamic, Vue marks it with a TEXT flag, so the diffing algorithm doesn't waste time checking attributes or classes.",

      "correct": [
        1
      ],
      "explanation": "If a piece of your template is purely static (no variables), Vue hoists it. Instead of creating a new Virtual Node on every render, it simply points to the same pre-created node, saving memory and CPU.",

      "correct": [
        1

        1

      "explanation": "Vue 3 divides the template into 'Blocks'. Each Block knows which of its children are dynamic. When updating, Vue iterates over the 'dynamic children' array rather than traversing the whole tree.",
