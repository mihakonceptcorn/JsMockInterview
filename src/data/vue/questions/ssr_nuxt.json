      ],
      "correct": [
        1
      ],
      "explanation": "The server sends 'dead' HTML for speed. Hydration is when Vue runs in the browser, matches the HTML to the Virtual DOM, and attaches event listeners to make the page 'live'.",

      ],
      "correct": [
        1
      ],
      "explanation": "useFetch is smart: it fetches the data on the server, serializes it into the HTML payload, and the client picks it up from there without making a second network request.",
      "interviewTip": "This 'Payload Extraction' is why Nuxt apps feel much faster and more integrated than custom SSR setups."
