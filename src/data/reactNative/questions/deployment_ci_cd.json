      "options": [
        "A way to encrypt the source code",

        "Naming your variables with specific prefixes"
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "Both Apple and Google require apps to be signed with a private key/certificate. Without it, the device will refuse to install the app for security reasons.",

      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "Since React Native apps execute a JS bundle, you can push a new bundle to a cloud service (like EAS Update or CodePush), and the app will download it on the next launch.",
      "interviewTip": "OTA updates are great for bug fixes but cannot be used to update native code (like adding a new library that requires `npx expo prebuild`)."
