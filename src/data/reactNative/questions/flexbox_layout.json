      "correct": [2],
      "explanation": "On the web, the default is 'row'. In React Native, it is 'column' to better align with the vertical nature of mobile devices.",
      "interviewTip": "Always verify the direction before debugging alignment, as 'justifyContent' and 'alignItems' swap roles depending on this property."

      "options": ["alignContent", "justifyContent", "alignItems", "selfAlign"],

      "options": ["center", "flex-start", "stretch", "baseline"],
      "correct": [2],
      "explanation": "By default, children are 'stretched' to fill the secondary axis of their parent unless a specific width/height is provided.",
      "interviewTip": "If your child component is 'disappearing', it might be because you set flexDirection: 'row' and the default 'stretch' is trying to find a height it doesn't have."

      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "Using 'center' for both justifyContent (main axis) and alignItems (cross axis) centers the content perfectly.",

        "It causes an error."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "A negative flex value allows a component to shrink when the content overflows the parent, but it won't take up extra space otherwise.",

      "explanation": "Modern React Native versions support the 'gap' property (as well as rowGap and columnGap), which adds space specifically between items.",
      "interviewTip": "Using 'gap' is much cleaner than applying margin to every child and then removing it from the last one."

      "correct": [0, 1],
      "explanation": "React Native primarily uses unitless numbers (logical pixels) and percentage strings. rem/em/vh/vw are not natively supported.",

      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "The Dimensions API (or the useWindowDimensions hook) provides the width and height of the current window/screen.",
