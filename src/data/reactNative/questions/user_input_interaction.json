      "explanation": "<TextInput> is the core component for text entry. It maps to 'EditText' on Android and 'UITextField' on iOS.",
      "interviewTip": "Always mention that <TextInput> is uncontrolled by default, but usually managed as a controlled component in React."

        "It disables copy-pasting",
        "It prevents the keyboard from showing up"

      "explanation": "It automatically adjusts its height, position, or bottom padding based on the keyboard's height.",
      "interviewTip": "On iOS, 'behavior=\"padding\"' is usually the best choice; on Android, it often works better without a behavior prop if the manifest is set to adjustResize."
