      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "Worklets are the core of Reanimated. They allow JS logic to run synchronously on the UI thread to ensure 60/120 FPS animations.",
      "interviewTip": "Worklets are identified by the 'use worklet'; directive at the top of the function (though the Babel plugin usually adds this automatically)."

      "options": ["useState", "useRef", "useSharedValue", "useAnimatedStyle"],
      "correct": [2],
      "explanation": "useSharedValue creates a thread-safe value that can be accessed and modified by both the JS and UI threads.",
      "interviewTip": "Changing a shared value (e.g., sv.value = 10) does not trigger a React re-render, making it extremely fast."

      "id": "ra-03",
      "stageId": "reanimated_advanced",
      "type": "single",
      "prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'useAnimatedStyle' hook?",
      "options": [
        "To create static styles",
        "To create a link between Shared Values and component styles",
        "To animate text content",

      "explanation": "You can add props like entering={FadeIn} or exiting={FadeOut} to any Animated component to handle its mounting/unmounting animation.",

      "options": ["withSequence", "withParallel", "withChain", "withQueue"],
      "correct": [0],
      "explanation": "withSequence takes an array of animations and runs them one after another.",

        "To translate text to another language",
        "To calculate the average value"

      "correct": [1],

      "options": ["withRepeat", "withLoop", "withReverse", "withBounce"],
      "correct": [0],
      "explanation": "withRepeat allows you to specify the number of iterations and whether the animation should 'reverse' (yoyo effect).",
      "interviewTip": "Setting the second argument to -1 makes the animation repeat forever."

      "prompt": "Why is it important to use 'Animated' components from the reanimated library (e.g., Animated.View)?",
      "options": [
        "Because standard views don't support flexbox",
        "Standard views cannot receive styles generated on the UI thread",
        "They are the only components that support colors",
        "They are required for Redux integration"

      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "The plugin analyzes your code for animation hooks and handles the complexity of moving that logic to the UI thread.",
