      "options": [
        "React Native automatically resizes one large image.",
        "By naming files with @2x and @3x suffixes (e.g., logo@2x.png).",
        "By using a 'resolution' prop on the Image component.",
        "It is only possible via the native Android/iOS folders."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "If you have 'logo.png', 'logo@2x.png', and 'logo@3x.png', React Native will automatically pick the best one for the device's screen density.",
      "interviewTip": "This ensures images look crisp without downloading unnecessarily large files on lower-end devices."

      "code": "<Image source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/photo.jpg' }} />",
      "options": [
        "The image takes up the full screen.",
        "The image will not render (it will have 0 width and 0 height).",
        "It automatically calculates the size based on the aspect ratio.",
        "It defaults to 100x100 pixels."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "Unlike local images (require), React Native does not know the dimensions of a network image until it is downloaded. You MUST specify size styles.",
      "interviewTip": "Always provide dimensions or a flex value to remote images to avoid invisible components."

      "options": [
        "Use the core <Svg> component.",

        "Convert the SVG to a Base64 string."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "SVGs are not native UI elements in mobile OS. You need the 'react-native-svg' library (and often 'react-native-svg-transformer') to render them.",
      "interviewTip": "Using SVGs is preferred for icons because they stay sharp at any size and reduce bundle weight."

      "options": [
        "To set the primary image URL.",

        "To set a background color."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "It improves UX by showing a local 'loading' or 'avatar-placeholder' image instead of a blank space while the network request finishes.",
      "interviewTip": "Note that 'defaultSource' is only supported on iOS. For Android, you usually manage this with state."

        "<BackgroundImage>",
        "<ViewStyle image={...}>"

      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "ImageBackground is a wrapper that has the same props as Image but allows you to nest children inside it.",

        "A method to encrypt images."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "Base64 allows you to pass the actual binary data of the image as a string. It's useful for small icons or images fetched from a local database.",
      "interviewTip": "Avoid using Base64 for large images, as it increases memory usage and slows down the JS thread."

      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "The 'tintColor' style property changes the color of all non-transparent pixels to the specified color.",

        "SVG (natively)"
      ],
      "correct": [0, 1, 2],
      "explanation": "While PNG, JPG, and GIF are universally supported, SVG requires a library. WebP is excellent for performance but requires extra care on older iOS versions.",

      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "Image.prefetch(url) downloads the image to the local disk cache so it displays instantly when the component later mounts.",

      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "Standard Image components often re-fetch or re-decode images when they scroll back into view. Using a library with a better cache helps fix this.",
