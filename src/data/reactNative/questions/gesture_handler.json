        "It uses less battery.",
        "It runs on the native thread, avoiding the 'bridge' bottleneck for smooth 60fps gestures.",
        "It is written in pure JavaScript and easier to debug.",
        "It only works with Expo."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
      "explanation": "RNGH interacts directly with the native platform's gesture recognition system, meaning touch events don't have to travel to the JS thread to be processed.",
      "interviewTip": "Always mention 'determinism' and 'responsiveness' when comparing RNGH to PanResponder."

      "explanation": "To ensure gestures are captured correctly, especially on Android, you must wrap your entry point (usually App.js) in a <GestureHandlerRootView>.",
      "interviewTip": "Missing this wrapper is the most common reason gestures 'silently fail' to trigger."

      "options": [
        "It speeds up the JS thread.",
        "It allows a component to recognize a gesture while a specific parent (like a ScrollView) is also active.",
        "It allows two different users to touch the screen.",
        "It converts touches into mouse clicks."
      ],
      "correct": [1],
