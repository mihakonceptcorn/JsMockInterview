  "rt-01": {
    "prompt": "Which component is used to define the mapping between a URL path and a React component?",
    "explanation": "<Route> is the fundamental building block. It renders its element only when the current URL matches the 'path' prop.",
    "interviewTip": "In React Router v6, the syntax changed to <Route path='/...' element={<MyComponent />} />.",
    "options": [
      "<Link>",
      "<BrowserRouter>",
      "<Route>",
      "<Switch>"
    ]
  },
  "rt-02": {
    "prompt": "How do you navigate to a new page programmatically in a functional component (e.g., after a form submission)?",
    "explanation": "The 'useNavigate' hook returns a function that lets you change the URL without a full page reload.",
    "interviewTip": "Use 'navigate('/path', { replace: true })' if you want to replace the current entry in the history stack instead of adding a new one.",
    "options": [
      "navigate('/dashboard');",
      "window.location.href = '/dashboard';",
      "history.push('/dashboard');",
      "navigate.to('/dashboard');"
    ]
  },
  "rt-03": {
    "prompt": "What is the primary difference between a standard <a> tag and a React Router <Link> tag?",
    "explanation": "<a> tags cause the browser to refresh the page. <Link> tags use the History API to update the URL and re-render only the necessary components.",
    "interviewTip": "Using <a> for internal navigation breaks the 'Single Page' experience and resets the application state.",
    "options": [
      "<a> tags are faster.",
      "<Link> tags change the URL without triggering a full page reload.",
      "<Link> tags only work for external websites.",
      "There is no difference; <Link> is just an alias."
    ]
  },
  "rt-04": {
    "prompt": "How do you access dynamic parameters from the URL (e.g., the 'id' in '/users/:id')?",
    "explanation": "The 'useParams' hook returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters defined in the route path.",
    "interviewTip": "Always ensure the variable name in destructuring matches the placeholder name in the Route path.",
    "options": [
      "useQuery",
      "useParams",
      "useRouteMatch",
      "useLocation"
    ]
  },
  "rt-05": {
    "prompt": "Which of these components must wrap your entire application to enable routing functionality?",
    "explanation": "BrowserRouter is the most common (uses clean URLs), while HashRouter uses the # fragment for compatibility with older servers/static hosting.",
    "interviewTip": "Most modern apps use BrowserRouter for SEO-friendly URLs.",
    "options": [
      "<BrowserRouter>",
      "<Routes>",
      "<HashRouter>",
      "<RouterContext>"
    ]
  },
  "rt-06": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the <Outlet /> component in React Router v6?",
    "explanation": "Outlet is used in a parent route's element to indicate where child route elements should be rendered.",
    "interviewTip": "This is the key to creating shared layouts (like a persistent sidebar or navbar).",
    "options": [
      "To link to external CSS files.",
      "To act as a placeholder for child routes in nested routing.",
      "To display a 404 error page.",
      "To redirect the user to the home page."
    ]
  },
  "rt-07": {
    "prompt": "How do you define a '404 Not Found' route in React Router v6?",
    "explanation": "The '*' (splat) path acts as a wildcard that matches any URL that hasn't been matched by previous routes.",
    "interviewTip": "Place the wildcard route at the very bottom of your <Routes> list.",
    "options": [
      "*",
      "404",
      "default",
      "fallback"
    ]
  },
  "rt-08": {
    "prompt": "What does the 'useLocation' hook return?",
    "explanation": "useLocation provides access to the 'location' object, which is useful for tracking page views or reading query strings (?query=abc).",
    "interviewTip": "You can use 'location.state' to pass hidden data between routes that doesn't appear in the URL.",
    "options": [
      "The user's GPS coordinates.",
      "A function to change the URL.",
      "An object containing the current URL path, search queries, and state.",
      "The component that is currently rendered."
    ]
  },
  "rt-09": {
    "prompt": "How can you pass query parameters (e.g., ?sort=asc) and read them in a component?",
    "explanation": "useSearchParams is the React-friendly hook for managing query strings. You can also manually parse location.search.",
    "interviewTip": "Query params are great for shareable UI states like filters or search terms.",
    "options": [
      "Using the 'useSearchParams' hook.",
      "Using the 'URLSearchParams' web API with 'location.search'.",
      "Using the 'useParams' hook.",
      "By defining them in the <Route path='...'>."
    ]
  },
  "rt-10": {
    "prompt": "What happens if you have multiple routes that match the current URL in React Router v6?",
    "explanation": "Unlike v5 which picked the first match (requiring 'exact'), v6 is smarter and calculates the most specific match automatically.",
    "interviewTip": "This means the order of routes matters less in v6 than it did in previous versions.",
    "options": [
      "React renders all matching components in a list.",
      "The app crashes.",
      "React Router uses a ranking system to pick the 'best' (most specific) match.",
      "It only picks the first one it finds."
    ]
  },
  "rt-11": {
    "prompt": "How do you implement a 'Redirect' after a user logs out in v6?",
    "explanation": "The <Navigate /> component is the declarative way to perform a redirect during rendering.",
    "interviewTip": "Use this for 'Protected Routes' where you check authentication before showing a page.",
    "options": [
      "Redirect",
      "Navigate",
      "Link",
      "Push"
    ]
  },
  "rt-12": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What is the URL after clicking 'Details'?",
    "explanation": "Links without a leading slash are 'relative' to the current path. Since we are at /products, appending 123 results in /products/123.",
    "interviewTip": "Use absolute paths (starting with /) if you want to navigate from the root of the site.",
    "options": [
      "/123",
      "/products/123",
      "/products/details/123",
