  "dep-01": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Fastlane' in the context of React Native deployment?",
    "explanation": "Fastlane automates the tedious parts of iOS and Android deployment. You can define a 'Lane' that builds the app, signs it with certificates, and uploads it to TestFlight or Google Play.",
    "interviewTip": "Fastlane is usually used within CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions) to avoid manual uploads from a developer's laptop."
  },
  "dep-02": {
    "prompt": "What is 'CodePush' (App Center) primarily used for?",
    "explanation": "CodePush allows you to fix bugs or update UI instantly by 'pushing' a new JS bundle to users. It bypasses the 24-48 hour store review process.",
    "interviewTip": "Remember: CodePush *cannot* be used for changes that involve new native modules or changes to the AppDelegate/MainApplication files."
  },
  "dep-03": {
    "prompt": "In the Expo ecosystem, what does 'EAS Build' provide?",
    "explanation": "EAS (Expo Application Services) Build takes your project and compiles it on Expo's servers. This is huge for developers who don't have a Mac but need to build an iOS app.",
    "interviewTip": "EAS works with both 'Managed' and 'Bare' React Native projects."
  },
  "dep-04": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the 'eas.json' snippet. What happens when you run 'eas build --profile preview'?",
    "explanation": "The 'internal' distribution and 'apk' build type are perfect for sharing a testable file with your team via a link, avoiding the store entirely.",
    "interviewTip": "Android uses .aab (Android App Bundle) for the Play Store, but .apk is needed for direct installation on devices."
  },
  "dep-05": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are required to sign a production iOS app for the App Store?",
    "explanation": "iOS code signing is a three-part system: the Certificate (Who you are), the App ID (What the app is), and the Provisioning Profile (The bridge between the two).",
    "interviewTip": "Managing these is often the biggest pain point in mobile dev. Tools like 'fastlane match' help share these across a dev team."
  },
  "dep-06": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Over-the-Air' (OTA) updating?",
    "explanation": "OTA updates (via Expo Updates or CodePush) are the mobile equivalent of 'refreshing the browser' on the web.",
    "interviewTip": "Note: Apple's rules allow OTA updates as long as you aren't significantly changing the 'primary purpose' of the app."
  },
  "dep-07": {
    "prompt": "Which file in an Android project contains the 'versionCode' and 'versionName'?",
    "explanation": "In Android, the app-level build.gradle is the source of truth for versioning. versionCode is an integer (for the store), versionName is the string (for users).",
    "interviewTip": "Every time you submit to the Play Store, the 'versionCode' MUST be higher than the last one."
  },
  "dep-08": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Semantic Versioning' (SemVer) as applied to mobile apps?",
    "explanation": "Major: Breaking changes. Minor: New features. Patch: Bug fixes. This is the standard for almost all software, including React Native apps.",
    "interviewTip": "For mobile, a Major change often indicates a required store update due to native changes."
  },
  "dep-09": {
    "prompt": "What is the role of a 'Keystore' in Android deployment?",
    "explanation": "If you lose your production Keystore, you cannot update your app on the Play Store anymore. It is critical to keep it backed up and secure.",
    "interviewTip": "Google Play App Signing now allows Google to manage the key for you, which is a safer modern alternative."
  },
  "dep-10": {
    "prompt": "How do you handle different environments (Development, Staging, Production) in React Native?",
    "explanation": "Environment variables allow you to switch between a local dev server and a production API without touching the source code.",
    "interviewTip": "Never commit sensitive API keys or secrets directly into your .env files if they will be committed to a public repo."
