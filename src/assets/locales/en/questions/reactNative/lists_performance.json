{
  "lp-01": {
    "prompt": "Why is <FlatList> more performant than <ScrollView> for long lists of data?",
    "explanation": "FlatList lazily renders items as they are about to appear and unmounts items that move far off-screen, saving significant memory.",
    "interviewTip": "This concept is called 'Windowing' or 'Virtualization'.",
    "options": [
      "It uses a faster C++ implementation for the scroll bar.",
      "It only renders the items currently visible on the screen and recycles views.",
      "It compresses images inside the list automatically.",
      "It runs on the Shadow Thread instead of the JS Thread."
    ]
  },
  "lp-02": {
    "prompt": "Which prop is required in <FlatList> to tell it what to render for each item in the data array?",
    "explanation": "The renderItem prop takes a function that receives an object (usually destructured as { item, index }) and returns a JSX element.",
    "interviewTip": "To keep performance high, define the renderItem function outside of your component or wrap it in useCallback.",
    "options": [
      "renderItem",
      "component",
      "ItemTemplate",
      "rowRenderer"
    ]
  },
  "lp-03": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'keyExtractor' prop?",
    "explanation": "By default, FlatList looks for an 'id' or 'key' property. If your data uses different names (like 'uuid'), you must use keyExtractor.",
    "interviewTip": "Always provide a unique string as a key. Avoid using the index if the data can be reordered or filtered.",
    "options": [
      "To encrypt the data for security.",
      "To provide a unique ID for each item so React can track changes and re-render efficiently.",
      "To sort the list based on the key.",
      "To link the list to a database."
    ]
  },
  "lp-04": {
    "prompt": "How do you render a header that scrolls along with the list items?",
    "explanation": "Using ListHeaderComponent ensures the header stays part of the list's scrollable area without breaking the virtualization logic.",
    "interviewTip": "Never wrap a FlatList inside a ScrollView of the same orientation; it breaks virtualization and causes performance warnings.",
    "options": [
      "Place the header inside a View above the FlatList.",
      "Use the 'ListHeaderComponent' prop.",
      "Wrap the FlatList in a ScrollView.",
      "Put the header in the first item of the data array."
    ]
  },
  "lp-05": {
    "prompt": "Which component should you use to render grouped data (e.g., a contact list organized by the first letter of the name)?",
    "explanation": "SectionList is designed specifically for data divided into logical sections, each with its own header.",
    "interviewTip": "SectionList data must be an array of objects, where each object has a 'data' array (e.g., { title: 'A', data: ['Alice', 'Aaron'] }).",
    "options": [
      "GroupedList",
      "SectionList",
      "FlatList with nested Maps",
      "CategoryView"
    ]
  },
  "lp-06": {
    "prompt": "What does the 'getItemLayout' prop optimize?",
    "explanation": "By providing the exact dimensions of items ahead of time, FlatList doesn't have to calculate them on the fly as you scroll, making it much smoother.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a 'pro' optimization for lists with hundreds of items where every item has a constant height.",
    "options": [
      "It allows the list to skip measurement of items if they have a fixed height/width.",
      "It defines the Flexbox layout of the row.",
      "It automatically calculates the font size of the text.",
      "It handles the spacing between items."
    ]
  },
  "lp-07": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What will happen if the user reaches the bottom of the list?",
    "explanation": "onEndReachedThreshold is a value from 0 to 1 representing how close to the bottom (as a fraction of the list length) the user must be to trigger the event.",
    "interviewTip": "This is how 'Infinite Scroll' is implemented in mobile apps.",
    "options": [
      "The list will stop scrolling.",
      "loadMoreData will be called when the user is within 50% of the end of the list content.",
      "loadMoreData will be called only when the user hits the exact pixel at the bottom.",
      "The list will restart from the top."
    ]
  },
  "lp-08": {
    "prompt": "How do you add a separator line between items without adding it to the top or bottom of the list?",
    "explanation": "ItemSeparatorComponent renders a component between every item, but excludes the very top and very bottom of the list.",
    "interviewTip": "This is cleaner than using margins or borders because it handles the 'edges' of the list automatically.",
    "options": [
      "Add a border to every item.",
      "Use the 'ItemSeparatorComponent' prop.",
      "Add a line inside the renderItem function.",
      "Use the 'gap' style on the FlatList."
    ]
  },
  "lp-09": {
    "prompt": "Which of these props can help improve performance on a very slow FlatList?",
    "explanation": "All these props fine-tune the virtualization engine. For example, a smaller windowSize reduces memory but might show more 'blank' spaces during fast scrolling.",
    "interviewTip": "Always start with defaults. Only tweak these if you notice visible lag or high memory usage.",
    "options": [
      "initialNumToRender (how many items to load initially)",
      "windowSize (how many pages of items to keep in memory)",
      "removeClippedSubviews (unmounts views off-screen)",
      "maxToRenderPerBatch (limits items rendered per scroll increment)"
    ]
  },
  "lp-10": {
    "prompt": "What is the 'extraData' prop used for in a FlatList?",
    "explanation": "FlatList is a PureComponent. It only re-renders if the 'data' prop reference changes. If your items depend on a global 'theme' or 'selectedID', you must pass that to extraData.",
    "interviewTip": "If your list isn't updating when you change a single item's selected state, you probably forgot extraData.",
    "options": [
      "To pass metadata to the database.",
      "To tell the FlatList to re-render when a piece of state *outside* the 'data' array changes.",
      "To add more items to the end of the list.",
      "To style the empty list state."
    ]
  },
  "lp-11": {
    "prompt": "How do you implement 'Pull to Refresh' in a FlatList?",
    "explanation": "refreshing (boolean) shows the spinner; onRefresh (function) is the callback where you fetch new data.",
    "interviewTip": "This provides the native 'bounce and spin' experience users expect on mobile.",
    "options": [
      "loading, onReload",
      "isFetching, onFetch",
      "refreshing, onRefresh",
      "active, onPull"
    ]
  },
  "lp-12": {
    "prompt": "What happens if you don't provide a unique key to list items?",
    "explanation": "React uses keys to optimize DOM/Native UI updates. Using the index can cause 'state' to stick to the wrong items if the list changes.",
    "interviewTip": "In an interview, explain that stable keys prevent expensive re-mounts.",
    "options": [
      "The app will crash immediately.",
      "React will show a warning and use the index as a key, which might lead to performance bugs.",
      "The list will be empty.",
      "The items will be rendered in random order."
    ]
  },
  "lp-13": {
    "prompt": "Which prop allows you to render the list in multiple columns (e.g., a grid)?",
    "explanation": "numColumns={2} will automatically arrange items in two columns. This requires your items to have a flexible width or matching fixed width.",
    "interviewTip": "Note that you cannot change numColumns on the fly; the component must remount for this to change.",
    "options": [
      "columnCount",
      "numColumns",
      "gridEnabled",
      "flexWrap"
    ]
  },
  "lp-14": {
    "prompt": "What is the 'ListEmptyComponent' used for?",
    "explanation": "It's a convenient prop to handle the empty state without using extra ternary operators in your JSX.",
    "interviewTip": "It makes your component code much cleaner.",
    "options": [
      "To delete all data from the list.",
      "To render a specific UI (like a 'No results found' message) when the data array is empty.",
      "To style the background of the list.",
      "To hide the list entirely."
