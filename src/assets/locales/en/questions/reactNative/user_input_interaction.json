  "ui-01": {
    "prompt": "Which component is the modern, more flexible alternative to TouchableOpacity and TouchableHighlight for handling touch interactions?",
    "explanation": "Pressable is a core component that provides more granular control over the various stages of press interactions (hover, press, focus).",
    "interviewTip": "Use Pressable when you need a highly customized hit box or complex feedback states.",
    "options": [
      "<Button>",
      "<Clickable>",
      "<Pressable>",
      "<TouchView>"
    ]
  },
  "ui-02": {
    "prompt": "What is the primary visual difference between TouchableOpacity and TouchableHighlight?",
    "explanation": "TouchableOpacity provides feedback by reducing the opacity (transparency) of the wrapped component. TouchableHighlight requires an 'underlayColor' and adds a solid highlight effect.",
    "interviewTip": "TouchableOpacity is the most commonly used for general buttons due to its simplicity.",
    "options": [
      "TouchableOpacity changes the background color; TouchableHighlight reduces opacity.",
      "TouchableOpacity reduces the opacity of the child; TouchableHighlight darkens or highlights the background color.",
      "There is no visual difference; they are identical.",
      "TouchableOpacity only works on Android."
    ]
  },
  "ui-03": {
    "prompt": "How do you mask the characters typed into a TextInput (e.g., for a password)?",
    "explanation": "Setting 'secureTextEntry' to true replaces characters with dots/stars, following native OS password input behavior.",
    "interviewTip": "Don't forget to pair this with 'autoCorrect={false}' and 'autoCapitalize=\"none\"' for login screens.",
    "options": [
      "passwordMode",
      "hideText",
      "secureTextEntry",
      "maskCharacters"
    ]
  },
  "ui-04": {
    "prompt": "Which prop is used in TextInput to define which type of keyboard should appear (e.g., numeric, email)?",
    "explanation": "The 'keyboardType' prop allows you to set specialized keyboards like 'numeric', 'email-address', or 'phone-pad'.",
    "interviewTip": "Remember that keyboard types can vary slightly between iOS and Android.",
    "options": [
      "inputMode",
      "keyboardType",
      "type",
      "keypadStyle"
    ]
  },
  "ui-05": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the <KeyboardAvoidingView> component?",
    "explanation": "Virtual keyboards take up screen space. KeyboardAvoidingView adjusts its position or padding so that inputs remain visible to the user.",
    "interviewTip": "The 'behavior' prop is key here; usually, 'padding' works best on iOS and 'height' or 'none' on Android.",
    "options": [
      "To prevent the user from using the keyboard.",
      "To automatically move components out of the way of the virtual keyboard so they aren't hidden.",
      "To change the color of the keyboard.",
      "To check if the keyboard is open for analytics."
    ]
  },
  "ui-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are valid ways to detect that a user has finished typing in a TextInput?",
    "explanation": "onEndEditing triggers when focus is lost; onSubmitEditing when the 'return' key is pressed; onBlur when the input loses focus.",
    "interviewTip": "Use 'onSubmitEditing' for single-line inputs to trigger form submission.",
    "options": [
      "onEndEditing",
      "onSubmitEditing",
      "onBlur",
      "onFinished"
    ]
  },
  "ui-07": {
    "prompt": "In React Native, what is the 'hitSlop' prop used for in touchable components?",
    "explanation": "Mobile screens can be hard to tap. 'hitSlop' makes it easier for users to hit small icons by extending the interactive area.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a great 'Senior Dev' trick for improving UX on small UI elements like 'Close' buttons.",
    "options": [
      "To increase the visible size of the button.",
      "To increase the touchable area without changing the visible size of the component.",
      "To add a shadow effect.",
      "To slow down the response time of the click."
    ]
  },
  "ui-08": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. Why might the keyboard NOT close when clicking 'Submit'?",
    "explanation": "React Native doesn't automatically close the keyboard on all actions. You typically import the 'Keyboard' module and call 'Keyboard.dismiss()'.",
    "interviewTip": "Another way is to wrap the screen in a 'TouchableWithoutFeedback' that calls dismiss.",
    "options": [
      "Buttons don't close the keyboard by default.",
      "You must manually call Keyboard.dismiss() or use the blur() method on the input.",
      "The input is broken.",
      "You need a special prop on the View."
    ]
  },
  "ui-09": {
    "prompt": "What is the result of using 'onChange' vs 'onChangeText' on a TextInput?",
    "explanation": "onChangeText is a convenience prop that returns just the text. onChange returns a full SyntheticEvent object containing the text in 'event.nativeEvent.text'.",
    "interviewTip": "In 99% of cases, you should use 'onChangeText' for cleaner state updates.",
    "options": [
      "onChangeText gives you the raw string; onChange gives you a complex event object.",
      "onChange is faster than onChangeText.",
      "onChange is only for Web; onChangeText is for Native.",
      "There is no difference."
    ]
  },
  "ui-10": {
    "prompt": "How do you make a TextInput multi-line for a biography or comment section?",
    "explanation": "The 'multiline' prop allows the text to wrap and the input to grow or scroll vertically.",
    "interviewTip": "Pair this with 'textAlignVertical=\"top\"' on Android to ensure the text starts at the top of the box.",
    "options": [
      "multiple",
      "textArea",
      "multiline",
      "expand"
    ]
  },
  "ui-11": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are feedback states provided by the 'Pressable' component's style function?",
    "explanation": "Pressable allows you to pass a function to 'style' or 'children' that provides these boolean states to help you render dynamic UI.",
    "interviewTip": "This is why Pressable is replacing Touchable components; it's much more descriptive.",
    "options": [
      "pressed",
      "hovered (on web/desktop platforms)",
      "focused",
      "clicked"
    ]
  },
  "ui-12": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of 'autoCapitalize=\"none\"' in an email input?",
    "explanation": "Most mobile keyboards capitalize the first letter by default. This is annoying for email addresses which are usually lowercase.",
    "interviewTip": "Valid values are 'none', 'sentences', 'words', and 'characters'.",
    "options": [
      "To prevent the first letter of the email from being uppercase.",
      "To encrypt the email.",
      "To stop the keyboard from suggesting words.",
      "To make the text smaller."
    ]
  },
  "ui-13": {
    "prompt": "How do you ensure the 'Submit' button on the keyboard is actually visible and labeled correctly?",
    "explanation": "returnKeyType changes the text or icon of the 'Enter' key on the virtual keyboard to better match the user's action.",
    "interviewTip": "Common values include 'search', 'next', 'done', and 'send'.",
    "options": [
      "use the 'returnKeyType' prop (e.g., 'done', 'go', 'send').",
      "use the 'buttonLabel' prop.",
      "It happens automatically.",
      "You must build a custom keyboard."
    ]
  },
  "ui-14": {
    "prompt": "What is the difference between a <Button> and a <TouchableOpacity>?",
    "explanation": "The core <Button> is very limited (only title and color). If you want a button with an icon, custom borders, or specific padding, you must use a Touchable or Pressable wrapper around a View.",
    "interviewTip": "Most production apps avoid the <Button> component entirely in favor of custom-built button components.",
    "options": [
      "Button is a basic component with a native look that can't be styled much; TouchableOpacity is a wrapper that lets you build any UI into a button.",
      "Button only works on iOS.",
      "TouchableOpacity is only for images.",
      "Button is faster."
