{
  "rn-env-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the primary difference between the 'Bridge' (Old Architecture) and 'JSI' (New Architecture)?",
    "explanation": "The legacy Bridge requires data to be serialized to JSON and sent across an asynchronous queue. JSI (JavaScript Interface) allows JS to hold references to C++ host objects, enabling direct, synchronous calls.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that JSI is the foundation for the New Architecture (Fabric and TurboModules)."
  },
  "rn-env-02": {
    "prompt": "Which layout engine does React Native use to calculate positions and sizes of components?",
    "explanation": "Yoga is a cross-platform layout engine developed by Meta that implements Flexbox for native mobile screens.",
    "interviewTip": "Yoga is written in C++ and is what translates your 'flex: 1' styles into actual pixel coordinates on iOS and Android."
  },
  "rn-env-03": {
    "prompt": "What does the 'Hermes' engine do for a React Native application?",
    "explanation": "Hermes is a small, lightweight JS engine. It uses bytecode pre-compilation (AOT) to make app launches significantly faster.",
    "interviewTip": "Starting with React Native 0.70, Hermes is the default engine for all new projects."
  },
  "rn-env-04": {
    "prompt": "What will be the result of this code when running in a React Native environment?",
    "explanation": "Core components like View are JavaScript components (usually functions or objects) that act as wrappers for native UI elements.",
    "interviewTip": "In the end, these components tell the native side to render a 'UIView' on iOS or an 'android.view' on Android."
  },
  "rn-env-05": {
    "prompt": "Which of the following are benefits of using 'Expo' over 'React Native CLI'?",
    "explanation": "Expo simplifies development by abstracting away the complex native code, though the CLI is still preferred if you need custom native module modifications that Expo doesn't support.",
    "interviewTip": "Expo is no longer 'just for beginners'; with 'Development Builds,' it is now powerful enough for professional enterprise apps."
  },
  "rn-env-06": {
    "prompt": "What is the 'Metro' bundler in React Native?",
    "explanation": "Metro is similar to Webpack for the web. It resolves dependencies and bundles your code for the mobile environment.",
    "interviewTip": "Metro is what powers Hot Module Replacement (HMR) / Fast Refresh during development."
  },
  "rn-env-07": {
    "prompt": "In the New Architecture, what replaces the 'UIManager'?",
    "explanation": "Fabric is the new rendering system. It is more efficient because it allows the UI to be updated synchronously and improves interop with host views.",
    "interviewTip": "Fabric is to Rendering what TurboModules are to Native Logic."
  },
  "rn-env-08": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of 'npx react-native run-ios'?",
    "explanation": "This command triggers the build process (via Xcode tools) and pushes the application to the iOS target.",
    "interviewTip": "You must have Xcode installed on a macOS machine for this command to work."
  },
  "rn-env-09": {
    "prompt": "Identify the three main threads in a standard React Native app (Bridge architecture):",
    "explanation": "The UI thread handles native view rendering; the JS thread runs the logic; and the Shadow thread calculates the layout (Yoga) before sending it to the UI thread.",
    "interviewTip": "If the JS thread is blocked by heavy logic, the UI remains responsive (animations might still work), but user interactions like button clicks won't process."
  },
  "rn-env-10": {
    "prompt": "What will happen if you run this code in a standard React Native component?",
    "explanation": "React Native does not use the browser's DOM. You must use native primitives like <View> and <Text>.",
    "interviewTip": "There is no 'div', 'span', or 'p' in React Native; everything text-related must be inside a <Text> component."
  },
  "rn-env-11": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Autolinking' in React Native?",
    "explanation": "Previously, you had to run 'react-native link'. Now, the CLI detects native modules in your node_modules and links them during build time.",
    "interviewTip": "For iOS, you still need to run 'pod install' after adding a library to finalize the autolinking."
  },
  "rn-env-12": {
    "prompt": "What is the entry point for native configuration in an Android React Native project?",
    "explanation": "The AndroidManifest.xml is where you define permissions, activities, and app metadata for the Android OS.",
    "interviewTip": "Knowing where these native files are (android/app/src/main/...) is essential for configuring things like deep links or camera permissions."
  },
  "rn-env-13": {
    "prompt": "In React Native, how is a 'TurboModule' different from a standard Native Module?",
    "explanation": "Standard modules are initialized on app startup even if not used. TurboModules are only loaded when required and communicate directly via JSI.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a key part of the New Architecture aimed at improving app startup performance."
  },
  "rn-env-14": {
    "prompt": "What command is used to start the Metro bundler manually?",
    "explanation": "This starts the local server that provides the JS bundle and assets to your running app during development.",
    "interviewTip": "If you get a 'Could not connect to development server' error, checking if this process is running is your first step."
  },
  "rn-env-15": {
    "prompt": "Which of these is a valid way to specify a version of React Native in a project?",
    "explanation": "The React Native version is managed like any other npm package in the package.json file.",
    "interviewTip": "Upgrading React Native versions often requires the 'React Native Upgrade Helper' tool because of changes in the underlying native files."
  },
  "rn-env-16": {
    "prompt": "What does the 'Shadow Tree' represent?",
    "explanation": "The Shadow Tree is where React Native stores the layout information (flex, margin, padding) so Yoga can work its magic.",
    "interviewTip": "In the New Architecture, the Shadow Tree is immutable and managed in C++ for better performance."
  },
  "rn-env-17": {
    "prompt": "How do you enable the New Architecture in a modern React Native project (iOS)?",
    "explanation": "For most current versions, you must explicitly enable it during the pod installation process for iOS or in gradle.properties for Android.",
    "interviewTip": "Be aware that some third-party libraries might not be compatible with the New Architecture yet."
  },
  "rn-env-18": {
    "prompt": "What happens when 'Fast Refresh' is triggered?",
    "explanation": "Fast Refresh combines 'hot reloading' and 'live reloading' to provide a seamless update experience without losing the component's state if possible.",
    "interviewTip": "If you modify a file that exports something other than a React component, Fast Refresh may perform a full reload to be safe."
  }
