  "sec-01": {
    "prompt": "What is 'SSL Pinning' and why is it used in React Native apps?",
    "explanation": "Even with HTTPS, an attacker can sometimes force a device to trust a fake certificate. SSL Pinning ensures the app rejects any certificate that doesn't match the 'pinned' one from your server.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention libraries like 'react-native-ssl-pinning' or 'TrustKit'. Warning: If your server certificate expires and you haven't updated the app, it will stop working!",
    "options": [
      "A way to pin the app's icon to the home screen.",
      "A technique to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks by ensuring the app only trusts a specific, pre-defined server certificate.",
      "A method to encrypt the JavaScript bundle.",
      "A feature that keeps the user logged in forever."
    ]
  },
  "sec-02": {
    "prompt": "How should sensitive keys (like API secrets) be stored in a React Native app?",
    "explanation": "Standard storage (AsyncStorage/MMKV) is unencrypted. The Keychain/Keystore provides hardware-level encryption designed specifically for secrets.",
    "interviewTip": "A great answer includes: 'I use .env files for build-time configuration, but device-specific secrets go into the Secure Keychain'.",
    "options": [
      "Hardcoded in a 'constants.js' file.",
      "Stored in the 'package.json' for easy access.",
      "In the iOS Keychain or Android Keystore using a library like 'react-native-keychain'.",
      "In the component's local state."
    ]
  },
  "sec-03": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of 'Jailbreak' or 'Root' detection in mobile apps?",
    "explanation": "On a rooted/jailbroken device, attackers can bypass sandbox restrictions and read your app's private data or intercept memory. Banks and high-security apps often block access on these devices.",
    "interviewTip": "Use 'react-native-jail-monkey' or 'expo-device' to check if the device environment is untrusted.",
    "options": [
      "To speed up the app on modified devices.",
      "To identify if the device's security layers have been compromised, allowing the app to disable sensitive features (like payments).",
      "To automatically update the OS.",
      "To allow the user to bypass the App Store."
    ]
  },
  "sec-04": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the Android config. What does 'minifyEnabled true' and 'proguardFiles' do?",
    "explanation": "Proguard/R8 shrinks the code and renames classes/methods to nonsense names (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c'), making the native binary difficult to read.",
    "interviewTip": "Always enable this for release builds. It's the first line of defense against decompilers.",
    "options": [
      "It makes the app's font sizes smaller.",
      "It obfuscates the code and removes unused code, making it much harder for hackers to reverse-engineer your Java/Kotlin logic.",
      "It encrypts the user's photos.",
      "It enables faster debugging on Android."
    ]
  },
  "sec-05": {
    "prompt": "Why is it dangerous to use 'console.log' in a production React Native build?",
    "explanation": "Logging doesn't just show in your terminal; it's broadcasted to the device's system log. Production builds should have logs stripped out.",
    "interviewTip": "Use 'babel-plugin-transform-remove-console' to automatically strip all logs during the production build process.",
    "options": [
      "It makes the app's UI look ugly.",
      "Logs are accessible via system tools (like logcat or Xcode) and can leak sensitive data (tokens, user info) to anyone with the device.",
      "It causes the app to be rejected by the App Store automatically.",
      "It drains the battery extremely fast."
    ]
  },
  "sec-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are valid methods to secure the JavaScript bundle itself?",
    "explanation": "Hermes provides 'security through compilation.' Obfuscators add an extra layer of complexity to the logic itself.",
    "interviewTip": "Explain that no JS code is 100% 'hidden,' but these steps make it significantly more expensive for an attacker to decode.",
    "options": [
      "Using 'JSC' instead of 'Hermes'.",
      "Using Hermes (it compiles JS to bytecode, which is harder to read than plain text).",
      "Using an obfuscator like 'javascript-obfuscator' before bundling.",
      "Renaming the .js file to .png."
    ]
  },
  "sec-07": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Deep Link Hijacking'?",
    "explanation": "URL schemes (myapp://) are not exclusive. To prevent hijacking, you should use 'Universal Links' (iOS) or 'App Links' (Android), which use a verified website domain to prove ownership.",
    "interviewTip": "Always prefer HTTPS-based 'Universal Links' over custom URI schemes for authentication flows.",
    "options": [
      "When a website links to the wrong page.",
      "When a malicious app registers the same URL scheme as your app (e.g., myapp://) to intercept sensitive data sent via links.",
      "When the internet goes down during a navigation event.",
      "When the user clicks a link too many times."
    ]
  },
  "sec-08": {
    "prompt": "What is the security risk of using 'allowFileAccess' or 'javaScriptEnabled' in a WebView?",
    "explanation": "WebViews are essentially mini-browsers. If you load untrusted URLs with full permissions enabled, you risk giving that site access to the app's internal sandbox.",
    "interviewTip": "Only enable the specific features you need, and always use 'originWhitelist' to restrict which domains the WebView can visit.",
    "options": [
      "The app will run out of memory.",
      "It can open the door to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks where malicious web content accesses local device files.",
      "The WebView will render too slowly.",
      "The user will be able to see the source code of the app."
    ]
  },
  "sec-09": {
    "prompt": "How do you implement biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID) in React Native?",
    "explanation": "These libraries provide a cross-platform API to check if biometrics are available and to prompt the user for authentication.",
    "interviewTip": "Always have a fallback to PIN/password authentication in case biometrics fail or aren't available on the device.",
    "options": [
      "It's built into React Native by default.",
      "Use a library like 'react-native-biometrics' or 'expo-local-authentication' to access the device's biometric sensors.",
      "You must write native Swift/Kotlin code for each platform.",
      "Biometric authentication is not possible in React Native."
    ]
  },
  "sec-10": {
    "prompt": "What is the recommended way to encrypt sensitive data before storing it locally?",
    "explanation": "Base64 is encoding, not encryption—it can be easily reversed. AES-256 is a strong encryption standard that requires a key to decrypt the data.",
    "interviewTip": "Store the encryption key in the Keychain/Keystore, never hardcode it in your JavaScript bundle.",
    "options": [
      "Use Base64 encoding.",
      "Use a library like 'react-native-aes-crypto' to encrypt data with AES-256 before saving to AsyncStorage/MMKV.",
      "Store data in plain text but hide the file.",
      "Encryption is not needed for mobile apps."
