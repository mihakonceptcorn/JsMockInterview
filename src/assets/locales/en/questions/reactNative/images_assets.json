  "ia-01": {
    "prompt": "How do you provide different image resolutions for different screen densities in React Native (e.g., Retina displays)?",
    "explanation": "If you have 'logo.png', 'logo@2x.png', and 'logo@3x.png', React Native will automatically pick the best one for the device's screen density.",
    "interviewTip": "This ensures images look crisp without downloading unnecessarily large files on lower-end devices.",
    "options": [
      "React Native automatically resizes one large image.",
      "By naming files with @2x and @3x suffixes (e.g., logo@2x.png).",
      "By using a 'resolution' prop on the Image component.",
      "It is only possible via the native Android/iOS folders."
    ]
  },
  "ia-02": {
    "prompt": "What happens if you omit the 'width' and 'height' styles for a remote (network) image?",
    "explanation": "Unlike local images (require), React Native does not know the dimensions of a network image until it is downloaded. You MUST specify size styles.",
    "interviewTip": "Always provide dimensions or a flex value to remote images to avoid invisible components.",
    "options": [
      "The image takes up the full screen.",
      "The image will not render (it will have 0 width and 0 height).",
      "It automatically calculates the size based on the aspect ratio.",
      "It defaults to 100x100 pixels."
    ]
  },
  "ia-03": {
    "prompt": "Which library is considered the industry standard for advanced image caching and performance in React Native?",
    "explanation": "FastImage replaces the standard Image component, offering better caching, priority loading, and GIF support using native SDWebImage (iOS) and Glide (Android).",
    "interviewTip": "Mention FastImage when asked about 'image flickering' or performance issues in long lists like FlatList.",
    "options": [
      "react-native-image-cache",
      "react-native-fast-image",
      "react-native-optimized-media",
      "expo-image-loader"
    ]
  },
  "ia-04": {
    "prompt": "How do you render an SVG file in a standard React Native project?",
    "explanation": "SVGs are not native UI elements in mobile OS. You need the 'react-native-svg' library (and often 'react-native-svg-transformer') to render them.",
    "interviewTip": "Using SVGs is preferred for icons because they stay sharp at any size and reduce bundle weight.",
    "options": [
      "Use the core <Svg> component.",
      "React Native does not support SVGs out of the box; you need 'react-native-svg'.",
      "Treat it like a normal image: <Image source={require('./icon.svg')} />.",
      "Convert the SVG to a Base64 string."
    ]
  },
  "ia-05": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'defaultSource' prop on the Image component?",
    "explanation": "It improves UX by showing a local 'loading' or 'avatar-placeholder' image instead of a blank space while the network request finishes.",
    "interviewTip": "Note that 'defaultSource' is only supported on iOS. For Android, you usually manage this with state.",
    "options": [
      "To set the primary image URL.",
      "To show a placeholder image (static asset) while the main network image is loading.",
      "To define the image's Alt text.",
      "To set a background color."
    ]
  },
  "ia-06": {
    "prompt": "Which component should you use to display a background image that contains other components as children?",
    "explanation": "ImageBackground is a wrapper that has the same props as Image but allows you to nest children inside it.",
    "interviewTip": "It's effectively a <View> with an absolute-positioned <Image> behind it.",
    "options": [
      "<View background={image}>",
      "<ImageBackground>",
      "<BackgroundImage>",
      "<ViewStyle image={...}>"
    ]
  },
  "ia-07": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Base64' image rendering?",
    "explanation": "Base64 allows you to pass the actual binary data of the image as a string. It's useful for small icons or images fetched from a local database.",
    "interviewTip": "Avoid using Base64 for large images, as it increases memory usage and slows down the JS thread.",
    "options": [
      "An image format that only works on Android.",
      "A way to embed image data directly into the string, avoiding an extra network request.",
      "A high-compression format for 4K images.",
      "A method to encrypt images."
    ]
  },
  "ia-08": {
    "prompt": "How do you handle images that need to be tinted (e.g., making a black icon blue)?",
    "explanation": "The 'tintColor' style property changes the color of all non-transparent pixels to the specified color.",
    "interviewTip": "This is great for icons, allowing you to use one PNG asset for multiple themes (Light/Dark).",
    "options": [
      "Edit the image in Photoshop.",
      "Use the 'tintColor' style property.",
      "Use 'overlayColor'.",
      "Change the 'opacity'."
    ]
  },
  "ia-09": {
    "prompt": "In Expo, which library is used for high-performance image handling that mimics the 'FastImage' functionality?",
    "explanation": "'expo-image' is a high-performance component designed for speed, supporting blurhash (placeholders) and smooth transitions.",
    "interviewTip": "It is currently the recommended way to handle images in the Expo ecosystem.",
    "options": [
      "expo-fast-image",
      "expo-image",
      "expo-media-library",
      "expo-assets"
    ]
  },
  "ia-10": {
    "prompt": "Which of the following are valid image formats supported by React Native?",
    "explanation": "While PNG, JPG, and GIF are universally supported, SVG requires a library. WebP is excellent for performance but requires extra care on older iOS versions.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention WebP as a way to reduce app size while maintaining high quality.",
    "options": [
      "PNG and JPG",
      "GIF",
      "WebP (supported natively on Android, needs setup on iOS)",
      "SVG (natively)"
    ]
  },
  "ia-11": {
    "prompt": "What is the result of using 'resizeMode: \"contain\"'?",
    "explanation": "'contain' ensures the whole image is visible within the frame, which may leave empty space (letterboxing).",
    "interviewTip": "Use 'contain' for logos and 'cover' for background photos.",
    "options": [
      "The image covers the entire container, potentially cropping the edges.",
      "The image is scaled to fit inside the container while maintaining its aspect ratio, without cropping.",
      "The image is stretched to fill the container, ignoring aspect ratio.",
      "The image is repeated as a pattern."
    ]
  },
  "ia-12": {
    "prompt": "How can you pre-load a remote image before showing it to the user?",
    "explanation": "Image.prefetch(url) downloads the image to the local disk cache so it displays instantly when the component later mounts.",
    "interviewTip": "This is perfect for pre-loading the next image in a gallery or a user's profile picture during login.",
    "options": [
      "cache",
      "prefetch",
      "load",
      "download"
    ]
  },
  "ia-13": {
    "prompt": "Why might an image disappear or 'flicker' when a FlatList scrolls?",
    "explanation": "Standard Image components often re-fetch or re-decode images when they scroll back into view. Using a library with a better cache helps fix this.",
    "interviewTip": "This is the 'smoking gun' for needing react-native-fast-image or expo-image.",
    "options": [
      "The JS thread is too fast.",
      "The component is being unmounted and the default Image component isn't caching efficiently.",
      "The image file size is too small.",
      "You are using the wrong resizeMode."
    ]
  },
  "ia-14": {
    "prompt": "What is a 'BlurHash'?",
    "explanation": "Blurhash allows you to show a beautiful, colorful blurred placeholder while the high-res image is still downloading.",
    "interviewTip": "It significantly improves the 'Perceived Performance' of your app.",
    "options": [
      "A way to encrypt an image.",
      "A compact string representation of a placeholder that looks like a blurred version of the image.",
      "A bug in the rendering engine.",
      "A type of image compression."
