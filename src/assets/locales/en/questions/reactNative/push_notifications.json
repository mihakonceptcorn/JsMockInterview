  "pn-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the primary difference between a 'Local Notification' and a 'Remote Push Notification'?",
    "explanation": "Local notifications (like an alarm or a timer) stay on the device. Remote notifications are triggered by an external server to re-engage the user.",
    "interviewTip": "For your JS Mock Interview app, a 'Local' notification would be perfect for a reminder to practice tomorrow.",
    "options": [
      "Local notifications require internet; Remote ones do not.",
      "Local notifications are scheduled by the app itself on the device; Remote ones are sent from a server via APNs or FCM.",
      "Remote notifications only work when the app is open.",
      "Local notifications are only for Android."
    ]
  },
  "pn-02": {
    "prompt": "Which service does React Native use to deliver notifications to iOS devices, even when using Firebase?",
    "explanation": "Even if you use Firebase, Google eventually has to hand the message over to Apple's APNs to reach an iPhone.",
    "interviewTip": "This is why you still need an Apple Developer Account and .p8 certificates even when using Firebase.",
    "options": [
      "GCM (Google Cloud Messaging)",
      "APNs (Apple Push Notification service)",
      "iCloud Sync",
      "WNS (Windows Notification Service)"
    ]
  },
  "pn-03": {
    "prompt": "What is a 'FCM Token'?",
    "explanation": "Your server sends messages to this token. If the user uninstalls and reinstalls the app, the token usually changes.",
    "interviewTip": "Always send the token to your backend database during the app launch or login.",
    "options": [
      "A password for the Firebase console.",
      "A unique identifier for a specific app instance on a specific device, used by the server to target that user.",
      "A piece of code that encrypts the message.",
      "The user's email address."
    ]
  },
  "pn-04": {
    "prompt": "How do you handle a notification click when the app is completely closed (Quit state)?",
    "explanation": "getInitialNotification is a 'one-time' check that returns the notification data if the app was launched by tapping that notification.",
    "interviewTip": "This is the most common place where 'Deep Linking' logic starts after a user taps a push.",
    "options": [
      "getInitialNotification",
      "onNotificationOpenedApp",
      "setBackgroundMessageHandler",
      "popNotification"
    ]
  },
  "pn-05": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of 'Notification Channels' on Android?",
    "explanation": "Android 8.0+ requires channels. Without a valid channel ID, notifications will not show up on modern Android devices.",
    "interviewTip": "On iOS, this concept doesn't exist; users can only toggle notifications on or off for the whole app.",
    "options": [
      "To stream video content inside the notification.",
      "To allow users to customize importance and sound for different categories of notifications (e.g., Chat vs. Marketing).",
      "To increase the speed of delivery.",
      "To bypass the 'Do Not Disturb' mode."
    ]
  },
  "pn-06": {
    "prompt": "What happens when a 'Silent' (Data-only) notification is received?",
    "explanation": "Silent notifications carry a data payload without a 'title' or 'body'. They are used to wake up the app to download new content quietly.",
    "interviewTip": "Be careful: iOS and Android both limit how many silent pushes you can send to prevent battery drain.",
    "options": [
      "The phone vibrates but shows no text.",
      "It doesn't show a UI alert but triggers a background task in the app to sync data.",
      "The notification is deleted immediately.",
      "It only works if the screen is on."
    ]
  },
  "pn-07": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are required to enable Push Notifications on iOS?",
    "explanation": "iOS is very strict. You need all these settings and a real device to test the full flow from server to handset.",
    "interviewTip": "Newer Xcode versions/Simulators have added limited support, but a physical device is still the industry standard for testing.",
    "options": [
      "Push Notifications Capability enabled in Xcode.",
      "Background Modes (Remote notifications) enabled in Xcode.",
      "A physical device (Simulators do not support remote push by default).",
      "A valid .p8 Auth Key or .p12 Certificate."
    ]
  },
  "pn-08": {
    "prompt": "What is the role of the 'setBackgroundMessageHandler' in React Native Firebase?",
    "explanation": "This handler runs in its own specialized task outside of your main React component tree.",
    "interviewTip": "Keep this function 'pure' and avoid using hooks or complex UI logic inside it.",
    "options": [
      "To change the wallpaper of the phone.",
      "To handle incoming data-only messages when the app is in the background or quit.",
      "To play a custom sound.",
      "To save the message to AsyncStorage."
    ]
  },
  "pn-09": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Notification Overloading'?",
    "explanation": "This is a UX term. High-frequency, irrelevant notifications are the #1 reason for app churn.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention 'Notification Personalization' and 'Frequency Capping' as solutions to this problem.",
    "options": [
      "Sending too many notifications, leading to users disabling them or uninstalling the app.",
      "When the notification text is too long for the screen.",
      "A bug that causes the same notification to appear twice.",
      "Using too many images in a notification."
    ]
  },
  "pn-10": {
    "prompt": "How do you request notification permissions from the user in React Native?",
    "explanation": "requestPermission() returns the authorization status (authorized, denied, provisional). On iOS, this triggers the system permission dialog.",
    "interviewTip": "Always check the current permission status before requesting to avoid annoying users with repeated prompts. On Android 13+, you also need to request the POST_NOTIFICATIONS runtime permission.",
    "options": [
      "getPermission",
      "requestPermission",
      "askForNotifications",
      "enablePush"
    ]
