{
  "ts-01": {
    "prompt": "Which directive is used to reactively update an HTML attribute, such as 'src' or 'disabled'?",
    "explanation": "v-bind (shorthand ':') is used to bind an attribute to an expression. For example, :disabled='isPending' will apply the disabled attribute if isPending is truthy.",
    "interviewTip": "In Vue 3.4+, you can use the shorthand :id instead of :id='id' if the attribute name matches the variable name."
  },
  "ts-02": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What will be rendered in the browser?",
    "explanation": "v-html updates the element's innerHTML with the provided string. Use this with caution as it can lead to XSS attacks.",
    "interviewTip": "Always warn about XSS when discussing v-html; only use it on trusted content."
  },
  "ts-03": {
    "prompt": "What is the difference between {{ message }} and v-text=\"message\"?",
    "explanation": "Interpolation (Mustaches) allows you to mix text and variables like 'Hello {{ name }}'. v-text will overwrite everything inside the tag with the variable's value.",
    "interviewTip": "Mustaches are preferred for readability, while v-text is rarely used unless you want to avoid 'Flash of Uncompiled Template' (though v-cloak is better for that)."
  },
  "ts-04": {
    "prompt": "How do you listen to DOM events (like a click) and run some JavaScript when they are triggered?",
    "explanation": "v-on (shorthand '@') is the directive for event listeners. It can call a method or run an inline expression.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention event modifiers like @click.prevent or @click.stop for handling common event logic declaratively."
  },
  "ts-05": {
    "prompt": "Which directive creates a two-way data binding on form input, textarea, and select elements?",
    "explanation": "v-model is 'syntactic sugar' that combines v-bind (to set the value) and v-on (to listen for input changes).",
    "interviewTip": "In Vue 3, you can have multiple v-models on a single custom component (e.g., v-model:first-name and v-model:last-name)."
  },
  "ts-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of the following directives are used to optimize performance by skipping re-renders or compilation?",
    "explanation": "v-once and v-memo are for runtime performance. v-pre is for compile-time performance, allowing you to show raw mustache tags without Vue processing them.",
    "interviewTip": "v-memo is a powerful Vue 3.2+ feature specifically for optimizing large v-for lists."
  },
  "ts-07": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What will happen to the input value after the button is clicked?",
    "explanation": "The .number modifier automatically typecasts the input string to a number using parseFloat().",
    "interviewTip": "Modifiers like .trim and .lazy are also vital for refining user input behavior without extra JS logic."
  },
  "ts-08": {
    "prompt": "What is the result of using a JavaScript expression inside mustaches, like {{ number + 1 }}?",
    "explanation": "Vue supports full JavaScript expressions inside data bindings, but they must be single expressions (no statements or flow control).",
    "interviewTip": "While expressions are powerful, keep them simple. If logic gets complex, move it to a 'computed' property."
  },
  "ts-09": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'v-cloak' directive?",
    "explanation": "v-cloak stays on the element until the Vue instance finishes compiling. You typically pair it with CSS like [v-cloak] { display: none } to hide mustache tags during page load.",
    "interviewTip": "This is mainly useful for server-rendered HTML where the template is visible before Vue hydrates."
  },
  "ts-10": {
    "prompt": "How do you dynamically bind a directive argument in Vue 3?",
    "explanation": "Dynamic directive arguments (introduced in Vue 2.6+) allow you to use a JavaScript expression as the directive argument by wrapping it in square brackets.",
    "interviewTip": "This is useful for creating generic components that can bind to different events or attributes based on props."
  }
