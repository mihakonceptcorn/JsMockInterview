  "rtk-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the primary purpose of a 'Slice' in Redux Toolkit?",
    "explanation": "createSlice automatically generates action creators and action types based on the reducers you provide, drastically reducing boilerplate code.",
    "interviewTip": "In legacy Redux, you had to write actions and reducers in separate files. Slices make it modular and concise."
  },
  "rtk-02": {
    "prompt": "How does Redux Toolkit allow you to 'mutate' state safely inside a reducer?",
    "explanation": "RTK uses Immer, which tracks changes to a 'draft' state and produces a brand new immutable state object for you.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a key benefit: you get the simplicity of mutation syntax with the safety of immutability."
  },
  "rtk-03": {
    "prompt": "Which hook is used to extract data from the Redux store state?",
    "explanation": "useSelector takes a selector function that receives the entire store state and returns the specific part you need.",
    "interviewTip": "useSelector also creates a subscription to the store and re-renders the component when the selected data changes."
  },
  "rtk-04": {
    "prompt": "What is the correct way to trigger a state change from a component?",
    "explanation": "The useDispatch hook returns the dispatch function from the Redux store. You call it with an action object to trigger a reducer.",
    "interviewTip": "Dispatching is the *only* way to trigger a state change in Redux, following the 'Single Source of Truth' principle."
  },
  "rtk-05": {
    "prompt": "What are the core principles of Redux?",
    "explanation": "Redux relies on predictability. The global state is stored in a single tree, and reducers must be pure functions that take (state, action) and return a new state.",
    "interviewTip": "Predictability makes features like 'Time Travel Debugging' possible."
  },
  "rtk-06": {
    "prompt": "What is 'createAsyncThunk' used for in Redux Toolkit?",
    "explanation": "createAsyncThunk generates promise lifecycle action types (pending, fulfilled, rejected) and handles the dispatching logic for you.",
    "interviewTip": "Handle the results of a thunk in the 'extraReducers' section of your slice."
  },
  "rtk-07": {
    "prompt": "Where do you combine all your slices to create the global store?",
    "explanation": "configureStore simplifies store setup. It automatically adds the Redux DevTools extension and the 'thunk' middleware.",
    "interviewTip": "configureStore is the RTK replacement for the legacy createStore function."
  },
  "rtk-08": {
    "prompt": "What happens if a reducer is not a 'pure function' (e.g., it uses Math.random() or calls an API)?",
    "explanation": "Reducers must be deterministic. Given the same state and action, they must always return the same result. Side effects belong in thunks or middleware.",
    "interviewTip": "Reducers = 'Logic/Calculation'; Thunks = 'Side Effects/Asynchronous work'."
  },
  "rtk-09": {
    "prompt": "How do you access the 'payload' of an action inside a reducer?",
    "explanation": "In Redux Toolkit, the data sent with an action is automatically placed in the 'payload' property of the action object.",
    "interviewTip": "Example call: dispatch(incrementByAmount(10)) results in action.payload being 10."
  },
  "rtk-10": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the <Provider> component in Redux?",
    "explanation": "Just like Context API, the Redux Provider uses React's context mechanism to pass the store down to hooks like useSelector.",
    "interviewTip": "Usually, you wrap the <Provider> around the <App /> in your main entry file (index.js)."
  },
  "rtk-11": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are benefits of using Redux DevTools?",
    "explanation": "DevTools provides a visual dashboard to see exactly how actions change the state, making debugging much easier.",
    "interviewTip": "It’s one of the strongest reasons to choose Redux for complex apps."
  },
  "rtk-12": {
    "prompt": "Identify the error in this selector usage:",
    "explanation": "Always consider the initial state. If the data hasn't loaded yet, accessing an index of an empty/undefined list will throw an error.",
    "interviewTip": "Use optional chaining: state.users?.[0]."
  }
