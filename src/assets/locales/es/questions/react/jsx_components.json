  "jc-01": {
    "prompt": "What happens if you define a React component with a lowercase first letter (e.g., function myHeader())?",
    "explanation": "React uses capitalization to distinguish between native HTML tags (strings) and custom components (functions/classes).",
    "interviewTip": "Always follow PascalCase for component names (e.g., MyComponent)."
  },
  "jc-02": {
    "prompt": "What is the result of the following component code?",
    "explanation": "JSX must have exactly one root element. You cannot return multiple adjacent tags without a wrapper.",
    "interviewTip": "You can fix this using a <div> or a Fragment (<>...</>)."
  },
  "jc-03": {
    "prompt": "How do you pass a JavaScript variable as an attribute in JSX?",
    "explanation": "To pass a variable as a prop or attribute, you must use curly braces without quotes.",
    "interviewTip": "If you put quotes around the braces, React will treat the whole thing as a literal string."
  },
  "jc-04": {
    "prompt": "What will be rendered by the following code snippet?",
    "explanation": "React does not render booleans, null, or undefined. Since isAdmin is false, the && operator stops, and nothing is displayed.",
    "interviewTip": "Be careful with 0; unlike false, React *will* render the number 0."
  },
  "jc-05": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of using React Fragments (<> ... </>)?",
    "explanation": "Fragments allow you to satisfy the 'single root' rule without bloating the HTML with unnecessary <div> tags.",
    "interviewTip": "Fragments are especially useful when working with CSS Flexbox or Grid where extra parent divs can break the layout."
  },
  "jc-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are valid ways to apply inline styles in JSX?",
    "explanation": "Inline styles must be objects. You can use camelCase (fontSize) or quoted kebab-case ('background-color').",
    "interviewTip": "The double curly braces {{ }} represent a JS object inside a JSX expression."
  },
  "jc-07": {
    "prompt": "How do you write a comment inside a JSX template?",
    "explanation": "JSX comments must be wrapped in curly braces and use the JavaScript multi-line comment syntax.",
    "interviewTip": "Single line // comments inside braces can sometimes accidentally comment out the closing brace."
  },
  "jc-08": {
    "prompt": "What is the output of this component?",
    "explanation": "React can render arrays directly. It simply concatenates the elements in the UI.",
    "interviewTip": "Usually, you'll use .map() to wrap each item in a tag like <li> to avoid this joined-text behavior."
  },
  "jc-09": {
    "prompt": "In JSX, which attribute is used instead of the standard HTML 'for' for labels?",
    "explanation": "'for' is a reserved keyword in JavaScript (used in loops), so JSX uses 'htmlFor' to avoid conflicts.",
    "interviewTip": "This is the same reason why 'class' becomes 'className'."
  },
  "jc-10": {
    "prompt": "What does the following return?",
    "explanation": "Expressions inside curly braces are evaluated and the result is rendered.",
    "interviewTip": "You can perform any JS calculation or call functions inside these braces."
  },
  "jc-11": {
    "prompt": "Why must you close all tags in JSX, even self-closing ones like <img> or <br>?",
    "explanation": "JSX is not HTML; it is a syntax extension that follows XML rules where every tag must be closed (e.g., <br />).",
    "interviewTip": "This is a common 'gotcha' for developers moving from plain HTML to React."
  },
  "jc-12": {
    "prompt": "Which of the following are valid ways to render 'nothing' from a component?",
    "explanation": "Returning null, false, or undefined tells React not to render any UI. An empty div renders an actual DOM node.",
    "interviewTip": "return null is the industry standard for 'conditionally hiding' a component."
  },
  "jc-13": {
    "prompt": "What is the result of the console log in this component?",
    "explanation": "JSX tags are transformed into objects that describe the UI. This is what 'console.log' will show.",
    "interviewTip": "These objects are the building blocks of the Virtual DOM."
  },
  "jc-14": {
    "prompt": "How do you render a string that contains HTML without escaping it?",
    "explanation": "React escapes all strings by default for security. 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' is the intentional way to render raw HTML.",
    "interviewTip": "The name is a reminder that this can expose your app to XSS attacks if the string comes from an untrusted source."
  },
  "jc-15": {
    "prompt": "What is wrong with the following component?",
    "explanation": "JavaScript stops executing a function after the 'return' keyword. The code below it is dead code.",
    "interviewTip": "Always wrap multi-line UI in parentheses to ensure the whole block is returned."
  },
  "jc-16": {
    "prompt": "Can you use a JavaScript 'if' statement directly inside a JSX block?",
    "explanation": "Braces {} only accept expressions. Statements like 'if', 'for', and 'switch' are not allowed inside JSX.",
    "interviewTip": "This is why ternaries (condition ? a : b) are so popular in React."
  },
  "jc-17": {
    "prompt": "What does the 'typeof' check return for a Fragment?",
    "explanation": "React Fragments (and other built-in types like Suspense or Profiler) are internal React Symbols.",
    "interviewTip": "Fragments are special 'empty' types that the renderer knows how to handle without a DOM node."
  },
  "jc-18": {
    "prompt": "Which of these is the correct way to pass a boolean prop 'isActive' as true?",
    "explanation": "Passing a prop name alone defaults to true. {true} is also explicit and correct.",
    "interviewTip": "Most developers prefer the shorthand <Tab isActive /> for boolean flags."
  }
