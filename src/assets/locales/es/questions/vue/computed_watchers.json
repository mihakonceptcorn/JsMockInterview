  "cw-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the primary advantage of using a 'computed' property over a regular 'method' in a template?",
    "explanation": "Caching is the killer feature. If you have an expensive calculation in a computed property, it will only run once and reuse that result until its source data changes. Methods run every time the component re-renders.",
    "interviewTip": "Use computed for data transformation (getters) and methods for event handling or actions.",
    "options": [
      "Computed properties can accept arguments.",
      "Computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies and only re-evaluate when those dependencies change.",
      "Computed properties run asynchronously.",
      "Computed properties are the only way to use math in templates."
    ]
  },
  "cw-02": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. How many times will 'Calculating...' be logged if the component re-renders 5 times, but 'count' never changes?",
    "explanation": "Because of caching, the computed function only executes once. As long as 'count' is the same, Vue returns the stored value immediately.",
    "interviewTip": "Computed properties are 'lazy'. If they aren't used in a template or another effect, they don't even run once!",
    "options": [
      "5 times",
      "1 time (on initial access)",
      "0 times",
      "Every time the template is accessed"
    ]
  },
  "cw-03": {
    "prompt": "When should you use a 'watcher' (watch) instead of a 'computed' property?",
    "explanation": "Computed properties must be 'pure' (no side effects) and return a value. Watchers are designed to execute logic (like saving to localStorage or fetching data) when a value changes.",
    "interviewTip": "Rule of thumb: Computed = Getters; Watchers = Side Effects.",
    "options": [
      "When you need to change the CSS class of an element.",
      "When you need to perform 'side effects' like an API call or manual DOM manipulation in response to a data change.",
      "When you want to join two strings together.",
      "When you need to return a value to the template."
    ]
  },
  "cw-04": {
    "prompt": "How do you make a watcher trigger immediately upon component creation, rather than waiting for the first change?",
    "explanation": "The 'immediate: true' option forces the watcher callback to run once with the initial value right when the watcher is initialized.",
    "interviewTip": "This is very useful for fetching data based on a prop as soon as the component mounts.",
    "options": [
      "lazy",
      "deep",
      "immediate",
      "flush"
    ]
  },
  "cw-05": {
    "prompt": "What does the 'deep: true' option do in a watcher?",
    "explanation": "By default, watchers only track 'shallow' changes (the reference of the object). 'deep' recursively traverses the object to catch changes in sub-properties.",
    "interviewTip": "Warning: Deep watching large objects can be very expensive for performance.",
    "options": [
      "It makes the watcher run in a separate thread.",
      "It allows the watcher to track changes inside nested objects or arrays.",
      "It ensures the watcher is the last thing to run in the lifecycle.",
      "It prevents the component from being destroyed."
    ]
  },
  "cw-06": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. Why is the watcher NOT triggering when 'user.name' changes?",
    "explanation": "When watching a 'ref' containing an object, the watcher is triggered only if the entire object is replaced. Internal property changes are ignored unless 'deep' is used or you watch a getter: `() => user.value.name`.",
    "interviewTip": "In Vue 3, watching a 'reactive' object automatically creates a deep watcher, but watching a 'ref' does not.",
    "options": [
      "Watchers cannot watch objects.",
      "The watcher is only watching the object reference, not its internal properties (needs 'deep: true').",
      "The watcher must watch 'user.value.name' directly.",
      "The console.log is missing quotes."
    ]
  },
  "cw-07": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are valid ways to create a 'Writable Computed' property (getter and setter)?",
    "explanation": "While most computed properties are getters, you can provide a setter to handle updates (e.g., parsing a 'fullName' string into 'firstName' and 'lastName').",
    "interviewTip": "Writable computed properties are excellent for wrapping state management (like Pinia) into a clean v-model.",
    "options": [
      "Passing an object with 'get' and 'set' functions to computed().",
      "Defining two separate computed properties with the same name.",
      "Using v-model directly on a regular computed property.",
      "Computed properties are strictly read-only and cannot be writable."
    ]
  },
  "cw-08": {
    "prompt": "What is the difference between 'watch' and 'watchEffect'?",
    "explanation": "watchEffect is more concise because you don't list dependencies; it 'discovers' them during execution. However, 'watch' is more precise and gives you access to 'oldValue'.",
    "interviewTip": "Use 'watch' if you need the previous value; use 'watchEffect' for simpler dependency tracking.",
    "options": [
      "watchEffect is for Vue 2 only.",
      "watchEffect automatically tracks all reactive properties used inside its function, whereas 'watch' requires you to explicitly state the source.",
      "watch is faster than watchEffect.",
      "watchEffect cannot be stopped."
    ]
  },
  "cw-09": {
    "prompt": "What is the difference between a computed property and a method in Vue?",
    "explanation": "Computed properties are only re-evaluated when their dependencies change. Methods run on every render, making them less efficient for expensive operations.",
    "interviewTip": "Use computed for derived state, methods for actions or when you need to pass arguments.",
    "options": [
      "There is no difference.",
      "Computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies; methods are called every time.",
      "Methods are faster than computed properties.",
      "Computed properties can only return strings."
    ]
  },
  "cw-10": {
    "prompt": "When should you use a watcher with the `immediate: true` option?",
    "explanation": "By default, watchers only run when the watched value changes. `immediate: true` makes the callback run once immediately with the current value.",
    "interviewTip": "This is useful for initializing data based on props or performing initial API calls.",
    "options": [
      "When you want the watcher to run immediately on component creation, before the first data change.",
      "When you want the watcher to run faster.",
      "When you want to watch multiple properties.",
      "When you want to prevent the watcher from running."
