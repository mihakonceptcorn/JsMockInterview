  "ssr-01": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Hydration' in the context of Vue SSR?",
    "explanation": "The server sends 'dead' HTML for speed. Hydration is when Vue runs in the browser, matches the HTML to the Virtual DOM, and attaches event listeners to make the page 'live'.",
    "interviewTip": "If the HTML from the server doesn't match what the client generates, you get a 'Hydration Mismatch' error—a common SSR headache.",
    "options": [
      "The process of downloading the CSS files.",
      "The process where the client-side Vue takes over the static HTML sent by the server and makes it interactive.",
      "Cleaning up the server cache after every request.",
      "A way to compress JavaScript files for faster delivery."
    ]
  },
  "ssr-02": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the Nuxt 3 code. What is the purpose of this built-in function?",
    "explanation": "useFetch is smart: it fetches the data on the server, serializes it into the HTML payload, and the client picks it up from there without making a second network request.",
    "interviewTip": "This 'Payload Extraction' is why Nuxt apps feel much faster and more integrated than custom SSR setups.",
    "options": [
      "It is a standard browser fetch wrapper.",
      "It is an SSR-friendly composable that prevents double data fetching (once on server, once on client).",
      "It only works in development mode.",
      "It encrypts the API response for security."
    ]
  },
  "ssr-03": {
    "prompt": "Which Nuxt.js directory is used to automatically generate routes based on file names?",
    "explanation": "Nuxt uses file-system routing. A file at `pages/about.vue` automatically becomes the `/about` route. No manual router configuration is needed.",
    "interviewTip": "For dynamic routes in Nuxt 3, you use square brackets, like `pages/quiz/[id].vue`.",
    "options": [
      "routes/",
      "pages/",
      "views/",
      "screens/"
    ]
  },
  "ssr-04": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. Where will this log appear in a Nuxt SSR environment?",
    "explanation": "Script setup code in SSR runs on the server to generate the HTML and then again on the client to hydrate the app.",
    "interviewTip": "Be careful! Code that uses browser-only globals like `window` or `localStorage` will crash on the server unless wrapped in a check or a hook like `onMounted`.",
    "options": [
      "Only in the browser console.",
      "Only in the server terminal.",
      "In both the server terminal (during render) and the browser console (during hydration).",
      "Only in the Nuxt DevTools."
    ]
  },
  "ssr-05": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Static Site Generation' (SSG) in Nuxt?",
    "explanation": "SSG (via `nuxt generate`) creates a folder of HTML files that can be hosted on a CDN (like Vercel or Netlify). It is the fastest and most secure way to serve content.",
    "interviewTip": "Nuxt 3 supports 'Hybrid Rendering,' allowing you to choose SSR for some routes and SSG for others.",
    "options": [
      "Rendering the page every time a user visits it.",
      "Pre-rendering every page of the app into static HTML files at build time.",
      "A way to disable JavaScript entirely.",
      "Using only static CSS without any JS."
    ]
  },
  "ssr-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are valid ways to handle SEO metadata in a Nuxt 3 component?",
    "explanation": "Nuxt 3 provides multiple ways to manage the `<head>`. `useSeoMeta` is the most performant and type-safe for social sharing tags.",
    "interviewTip": "Since Nuxt renders HTML on the server, these tags are visible to search engine bots immediately.",
    "options": [
      "useHead({ title: 'My Quiz' })",
      "useSeoMeta({ description: 'Practice JS' })",
      "<Title>My Quiz</Title> (built-in component)",
      "Adding a <meta> tag manually in the index.html"
    ]
  },
  "ssr-07": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the component code. What is the behavior of <ClientOnly>?",
    "explanation": "Some components (like those using D3 or Canvas) simply cannot run on the server. <ClientOnly> prevents server-side errors and hydration mismatches.",
    "interviewTip": "You can also provide a 'placeholder' slot to show a loading state on the server.",
    "options": [
      "It hides the chart from users.",
      "It tells Nuxt to skip rendering this component on the server and only render it in the browser.",
      "It optimizes the chart for mobile devices.",
      "It prevents the chart from using any network resources."
    ]
  },
  "ssr-08": {
    "prompt": "What is the role of 'Nitro' in the Nuxt 3 ecosystem?",
    "explanation": "Nitro is the powerful server backend for Nuxt. It enables features like API routes and allows the app to be deployed anywhere from a traditional server to Cloudflare Workers.",
    "interviewTip": "Mentioning Nitro shows you understand that Nuxt is a 'Full-Stack' framework, not just a frontend library.",
    "options": [
      "The CSS engine for Nuxt.",
      "The server engine that allows Nuxt to run on any provider (Node.js, Serverless, Edge Workers).",
      "The image optimization tool.",
      "The unit testing framework for Nuxt."
    ]
  },
  "ssrn-09": {
    "prompt": "What is the main benefit of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Vue?",
    "explanation": "SSR renders the Vue application on the server, sending fully-formed HTML to the client, which improves perceived performance and SEO.",
    "interviewTip": "SSR comes with tradeoffs like increased server load and complexity. Consider Static Site Generation (SSG) for content-heavy sites.",
    "options": [
      "Faster client-side interactivity.",
      "Better SEO and faster initial page load by sending pre-rendered HTML to the browser.",
      "Smaller bundle sizes.",
      "Automatic code splitting."
    ]
  },
  "ssrn-10": {
    "prompt": "What is Nuxt.js?",
    "explanation": "Nuxt simplifies Vue development by providing conventions, automatic routing, SSR/SSG support, and a rich module ecosystem.",
    "interviewTip": "Nuxt 3 is built on Vue 3 and Vite, offering significantly better performance than Nuxt 2.",
    "options": [
      "A Vue component library.",
      "A meta-framework for Vue that provides SSR, SSG, routing, and other features out of the box.",
      "A CSS preprocessor.",
      "A testing framework."
