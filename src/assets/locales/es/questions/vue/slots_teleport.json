  "sl-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the <slot> element in a child component?",
    "explanation": "Slots act as placeholders. Whatever content the parent places between the child component's tags will replace the <slot> tag in the final render.",
    "interviewTip": "Content inside slots has access to the parent's data scope, not the child's (unless using Scoped Slots).",
    "options": [
      "To define a place where the parent can inject its own HTML or components.",
      "To create a new reactive state.",
      "To teleport the component to the footer.",
      "To link the component to an external CSS file."
    ]
  },
  "sl-02": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. How do you pass content to the 'header' slot specifically?",
    "explanation": "v-slot:header is the full syntax, and #header is the shorthand. Both are used on a <template> tag within the parent to target a named slot.",
    "interviewTip": "Named slots are essential for building layout components (like Cards or Page Shells).",
    "options": [
      "<template #header>",
      "<template v-slot:header>",
      "Both of the above are correct.",
      "<header-slot>"
    ]
  },
  "sl-03": {
    "prompt": "What are 'Scoped Slots' used for?",
    "explanation": "Scoped slots allow a child to provide data to the content injected by the parent. For example, a List component providing individual 'item' data to a custom row template provided by the parent.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a high-level pattern for creating flexible, reusable components like Data Tables.",
    "options": [
      "To prevent CSS from leaking out of the slot.",
      "To allow the child component to pass data 'up' to the parent's slot content.",
      "To make the slot content private to the component.",
      "To automatically translate the text in the slot."
    ]
  },
  "sl-04": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What will happen to the 'Modal' component in the DOM?",
    "explanation": "Teleport allows you to maintain the component's logical position (props/state) in the Vue tree while rendering it elsewhere in the HTML DOM.",
    "interviewTip": "This is the 'correct' way to handle Modals/Dialogs to avoid `z-index` and `overflow: hidden` issues from parent containers.",
    "options": [
      "It will be rendered inside the current component's div.",
      "It will be physically moved in the DOM and rendered as a direct child of the <body> tag.",
      "It will be hidden until the user clicks 'body'.",
      "Vue will throw an error if 'body' is not a Vue component."
    ]
  },
  "sl-05": {
    "prompt": "How do you provide 'fallback' content that only shows if the parent doesn't provide any slot content?",
    "explanation": "Any content placed between <slot> and </slot> in the child component serves as the default content if the parent leaves the tags empty.",
    "interviewTip": "This is great for buttons where you want a default 'Submit' label but allow customization.",
    "options": [
      "v-else=\"default\"",
      "Simply place text/tags inside the <slot> tags.",
      "Using the 'fallback' prop.",
      "Vue doesn't support fallback content."
    ]
  },
  "sl-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of the following statements about <Teleport> are true?",
    "explanation": "Teleport targets can be CSS selectors (like '#app', '.container', or 'body'). Even though the DOM moves, the Vue logical tree remains intact.",
    "interviewTip": "Confirm that Teleport doesn't break the 'one-way data flow' or event bubbling in the Vue tree.",
    "options": [
      "The 'to' target must exist in the DOM before the component is mounted.",
      "Props and events still work normally through the Vue component hierarchy.",
      "It can only teleport to IDs, not tag names.",
      "Multiple Teleports can move content to the same target."
    ]
  },
  "sl-07": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the Scoped Slot syntax. How does the parent access the child's data?",
    "explanation": "The value of v-slot (here 'slotProps') is an object containing all the props passed to the slot from the child. You can also destructure it: v-slot=\"{ user }\".",
    "interviewTip": "Destructuring scoped slot props is standard practice for cleaner templates.",
    "options": [
      "v-data",
      "slotProps",
      "props",
      "defineProps"
    ]
  },
  "sl-08": {
    "prompt": "What happens to the state of a component inside <Teleport> if it is disabled?",
    "explanation": "Teleport has a 'disabled' prop. This is useful for things like a 'PIP' (Picture-in-Picture) window that might toggle between being in the layout or floating.",
    "interviewTip": "Mentioning the 'disabled' prop shows you've read the advanced documentation for Teleport.",
    "options": [
      "The state is lost.",
      "The component is unmounted.",
      "Teleport doesn't have a 'disabled' prop; it always teleports.",
      "If :disabled=\"true\", the content renders in its original location instead of the target."
    ]
  },
  "st-09": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the <Teleport> component in Vue 3?",
    "explanation": "Teleport is useful for modals, toasts, or tooltips that need to be rendered at the document body level to avoid z-index or overflow issues.",
    "interviewTip": "Teleport was called Portal in the RFC but was renamed before Vue 3 release.",
    "options": [
      "To move data between components.",
      "To render a component's template in a different part of the DOM tree, outside its parent hierarchy.",
      "To lazy-load components.",
      "To create portals to other pages."
    ]
  },
  "st-10": {
    "prompt": "How do you access slot content in the parent component?",
    "explanation": "Scoped slots allow child components to pass data back to the parent's slot content, enabling powerful patterns like renderless components.",
    "interviewTip": "Scoped slots are the foundation of many Vue UI libraries for maximum flexibility.",
    "options": [
      "Slots are one-way only; you cannot access them from the parent.",
      "Use scoped slots to pass data from child to parent.",
      "Use the $slots property.",
      "Use v-model."
