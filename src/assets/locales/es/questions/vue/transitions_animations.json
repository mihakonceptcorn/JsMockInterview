{
  "ta-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the primary role of the built-in <Transition> component?",
    "explanation": "<Transition> doesn't animate things itself; it detects when an element is added/removed and adds classes like '-enter-from' and '-enter-active' so your CSS can do the work.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that <Transition> only works on a single element or component. For lists, you must use <TransitionGroup>."
  },
  "ta-02": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the CSS classes below. Which class defines the 'target' state (the end result) of an entering element?",
    "explanation": "The six transition classes are: enter-from, enter-active, enter-to, leave-from, leave-active, and leave-to.",
    "interviewTip": "If you don't provide a 'name' attribute to the transition, the classes default to 'v-enter-from', etc."
  },
  "ta-03": {
    "prompt": "How do you handle animations for a list of items generated by 'v-for'?",
    "explanation": "<TransitionGroup> renders a real element (default is no element in Vue 3, but can be specified) and handles the movement of items as the list is reordered.",
    "interviewTip": "Items inside a <TransitionGroup> MUST have a unique :key for the animations to work."
  },
  "ta-04": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What does the 'mode' attribute do?",
    "explanation": "Without 'out-in', both components would be in the DOM at the same time during the transition, often causing layout 'jumping'.",
    "interviewTip": "The 'out-in' mode is almost always preferred for smooth page or component transitions."
  },
  "ta-05": {
    "prompt": "How can you trigger a transition when a component first mounts, even without a state change?",
    "explanation": "The 'appear' attribute tells Vue to apply the enter transition classes as soon as the element is first rendered.",
    "interviewTip": "This is great for 'hero' sections or entrance animations for a landing page."
  },
  "ta-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are valid 'JavaScript Hooks' provided by the <Transition> component for complex animations (e.g., using GSAP)?",
    "explanation": "Vue provides JS hooks like @before-enter, @enter, and @leave so you can use libraries like GreenSock (GSAP) or Anime.js instead of CSS.",
    "interviewTip": "When using JS hooks, it's best to add :css='false' to tell Vue to skip CSS detection for a performance boost."
  },
  "ta-07": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'v-move' class in TransitionGroup?",
    "explanation": "While enter/leave classes handle appearing/disappearing, 'v-move' (or '[name]-move') uses the FLIP technique to smoothly slide items to their new positions.",
    "interviewTip": "This is how you get those smooth 'shuffling' effects in lists."
  },
  "ta-08": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What is wrong with this animation setup?",
    "explanation": "A <Transition> only animates a single child. If you have multiple elements toggling, they need unique keys so Vue can track which is which, or you should use a single component with :is.",
    "interviewTip": "Always use unique keys when transitioning between two different elements of the same tag type."
  },
  "ta-09": {
    "prompt": "What CSS classes does Vue apply during a transition?",
    "explanation": "Vue applies these 6 classes at different stages of the transition, allowing you to define CSS transitions or animations.",
    "interviewTip": "You can customize the prefix by setting the name attribute on <Transition>."
  },
  "ta-10": {
    "prompt": "How do you animate a list of items in Vue?",
    "explanation": "<TransitionGroup> applies transitions to multiple elements rendered with v-for, including enter, leave, and move transitions.",
    "interviewTip": "Always provide unique keys for TransitionGroup children for proper animation tracking."
  }
