{
  "ta-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the primary role of the built-in <Transition> component?",
    "explanation": "<Transition> doesn't animate things itself; it detects when an element is added/removed and adds classes like '-enter-from' and '-enter-active' so your CSS can do the work.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that <Transition> only works on a single element or component. For lists, you must use <TransitionGroup>.",
    "options": [
      "To speed up the frame rate of the entire app.",
      "To automatically apply CSS classes to an element at specific stages of its entering or leaving the DOM.",
      "To convert CSS into JavaScript code.",
      "To prevent the user from clicking buttons during an update."
    ]
  },
  "ta-02": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the CSS classes below. Which class defines the 'target' state (the end result) of an entering element?",
    "explanation": "The six transition classes are: enter-from, enter-active, enter-to, leave-from, leave-active, and leave-to.",
    "interviewTip": "If you don't provide a 'name' attribute to the transition, the classes default to 'v-enter-from', etc.",
    "options": [
      "enter-to",
      "enter-final",
      "enter-end",
      "enter-done"
    ]
  },
  "ta-03": {
    "prompt": "How do you handle animations for a list of items generated by 'v-for'?",
    "explanation": "<TransitionGroup> renders a real element (default is no element in Vue 3, but can be specified) and handles the movement of items as the list is reordered.",
    "interviewTip": "Items inside a <TransitionGroup> MUST have a unique :key for the animations to work.",
    "options": [
      "Wrap the v-for in a regular <Transition>.",
      "Wrap the v-for in a <TransitionGroup> component.",
      "Animations are not supported for lists.",
      "Use v-animate on every item."
    ]
  },
  "ta-04": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What does the 'mode' attribute do?",
    "explanation": "Without 'out-in', both components would be in the DOM at the same time during the transition, often causing layout 'jumping'.",
    "interviewTip": "The 'out-in' mode is almost always preferred for smooth page or component transitions.",
    "options": [
      "It makes the animation run twice.",
      "It ensures the current component finishes its 'leave' animation before the new component starts its 'enter' animation.",
      "It forces the animation to run in the background thread.",
      "It randomizes the transition effect."
    ]
  },
  "ta-05": {
    "prompt": "How can you trigger a transition when a component first mounts, even without a state change?",
    "explanation": "The 'appear' attribute tells Vue to apply the enter transition classes as soon as the element is first rendered.",
    "interviewTip": "This is great for 'hero' sections or entrance animations for a landing page.",
    "options": [
      "Use the 'appear' attribute on the <Transition> component.",
      "Use v-if=\"true\".",
      "Transitions only work on updates, not initial mount.",
      "Call transition.start() in onMounted."
    ]
  },
  "ta-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are valid 'JavaScript Hooks' provided by the <Transition> component for complex animations (e.g., using GSAP)?",
    "explanation": "Vue provides JS hooks like @before-enter, @enter, and @leave so you can use libraries like GreenSock (GSAP) or Anime.js instead of CSS.",
    "interviewTip": "When using JS hooks, it's best to add :css='false' to tell Vue to skip CSS detection for a performance boost.",
    "options": [
      "@before-enter",
      "@enter",
      "@after-leave",
      "@on-animating"
    ]
  },
  "ta-07": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'v-move' class in TransitionGroup?",
    "explanation": "While enter/leave classes handle appearing/disappearing, 'v-move' (or '[name]-move') uses the FLIP technique to smoothly slide items to their new positions.",
    "interviewTip": "This is how you get those smooth 'shuffling' effects in lists.",
    "options": [
      "To allow the user to drag and drop items.",
      "To animate the position change of items when the list is reordered (e.g., via sorting).",
      "To move the component to a different DOM node.",
      "To delete the item from the list."
    ]
  },
  "ta-08": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What is wrong with this animation setup?",
    "explanation": "A <Transition> only animates a single child. If you have multiple elements toggling, they need unique keys so Vue can track which is which, or you should use a single component with :is.",
    "interviewTip": "Always use unique keys when transitioning between two different elements of the same tag type.",
    "options": [
      "A Transition can only have one child element at a time.",
      "The divs are missing keys.",
      "Both of the above.",
      "Nothing is wrong."
    ]
  },
  "ta-09": {
    "prompt": "What CSS classes does Vue apply during a transition?",
    "explanation": "Vue applies these 6 classes at different stages of the transition, allowing you to define CSS transitions or animations.",
    "interviewTip": "You can customize the prefix by setting the name attribute on <Transition>.",
    "options": [
      "Only .fade-in and .fade-out",
      "v-enter-from, v-enter-active, v-enter-to, v-leave-from, v-leave-active, v-leave-to",
      "Only .transition-start and .transition-end",
      "Vue does not apply any classes."
    ]
  },
  "ta-10": {
    "prompt": "How do you animate a list of items in Vue?",
    "explanation": "<TransitionGroup> applies transitions to multiple elements rendered with v-for, including enter, leave, and move transitions.",
    "interviewTip": "Always provide unique keys for TransitionGroup children for proper animation tracking.",
    "options": [
      "Use <Transition> for each item.",
      "Use <TransitionGroup> component.",
      "Use v-for with :key.",
      "Animations are not supported for lists."
    ]
