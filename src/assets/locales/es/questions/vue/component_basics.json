{
  "cb-01": {
    "prompt": "In Vue, what is the 'One-Way Data Flow' principle regarding props?",
    "explanation": "This prevents child components from accidentally mutating the parent's state, which would make the data flow hard to understand and debug.",
    "interviewTip": "If you try to mutate a prop in a child, Vue will throw a warning in the console. If you need to change it, use a local 'ref' or emit an event."
  },
  "cb-02": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. How does the child component notify the parent that a button was clicked?",
    "explanation": "Custom events use the v-on (or @) syntax just like native DOM events. The parent listens for the event name defined in the child's $emit call.",
    "interviewTip": "Vue 3 recommends declaring emitted events using the 'emits' option or 'defineEmits' for better documentation and validation."
  },
  "cb-03": {
    "prompt": "How do you define props with validation in a Vue 3 <script setup> component?",
    "explanation": "defineProps is a compiler macro available inside <script setup>. It doesn't need to be imported and allows for runtime validation of the data being passed.",
    "interviewTip": "Prop validation is your first line of defense against bugs in large teams. Always use object syntax for props instead of arrays."
  },
  "cb-04": {
    "prompt": "What are 'Fallthrough Attributes' in Vue 3?",
    "explanation": "If a component has a single root element, attributes passed to it (that aren't declared as props) 'fall through' to that root element.",
    "interviewTip": "You can disable this behavior by setting 'inheritAttrs: false' and manually binding attributes using '$attrs'."
  },
  "cb-05": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What is the correct way for the parent to pass a dynamic numeric value to the child?",
    "explanation": "Without the colon (:), '42' is passed as a static string. With the colon (:), it is evaluated as a JavaScript expression, passing it as a number.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a common beginner mistake. Use v-bind (:) for any value that isn't a literal string."
  },
  "cb-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of the following are valid ways to communicate between components that are NOT in a direct parent-child relationship?",
    "explanation": "Provide/Inject is great for 'Prop Drilling' avoidance. Pinia is for global state. Direct mutation of $parent is highly discouraged as it creates tight coupling.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention Provide/Inject as the Vue equivalent to React's Context API."
  },
  "cb-07": {
    "prompt": "What happens if a child emits an event but the parent is not listening for it?",
    "explanation": "Unlike DOM events, Vue's custom events do not bubble by default. If no listener is present on the immediate parent, the event is simply lost.",
    "interviewTip": "This is why debugging missing events usually starts with checking the event name spelling in the @listener."
  },
  "cb-08": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. Why is 'defineEmits' used here?",
    "explanation": "Using defineEmits makes your component's 'contract' explicit, helping developers (and IDEs) understand how to interact with it.",
    "interviewTip": "In TypeScript, you can even define the types of the arguments passed with the event using defineEmits<{ (e: 'change', id: number): void }>."
  },
  "cb-09": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when rendering lists in Vue?",
    "explanation": "Keys give Vue a hint about the identity of each node. Without keys, Vue uses an algorithm that minimizes element movement but can cause issues with stateful components or transitions.",
    "interviewTip": "Always use unique, stable keys (like IDs) rather than array indexes for dynamic lists."
  },
  "cb-10": {
    "prompt": "How do you emit a custom event from a child component to its parent in Vue 3?",
    "explanation": "In <script setup>, you use defineEmits to declare events, then call emit with the event name and optional payload.",
    "interviewTip": "Vue 3 encourages explicit event declarations for better type safety and documentation."
  }
