  "cb-01": {
    "prompt": "In Vue, what is the 'One-Way Data Flow' principle regarding props?",
    "explanation": "This prevents child components from accidentally mutating the parent's state, which would make the data flow hard to understand and debug.",
    "interviewTip": "If you try to mutate a prop in a child, Vue will throw a warning in the console. If you need to change it, use a local 'ref' or emit an event.",
    "options": [
      "Props can only be passed to parent components, never children.",
      "A child component should not mutate a prop directly; it should instead emit an event to ask the parent to change the data.",
      "Data can only flow through a central state manager like Pinia.",
      "Props are automatically synchronized both ways between parent and child."
    ]
  },
  "cb-02": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. How does the child component notify the parent that a button was clicked?",
    "explanation": "Custom events use the v-on (or @) syntax just like native DOM events. The parent listens for the event name defined in the child's $emit call.",
    "interviewTip": "Vue 3 recommends declaring emitted events using the 'emits' option or 'defineEmits' for better documentation and validation.",
    "options": [
      ":custom-event",
      "@custom-event",
      "v-model:custom-event",
      "on-custom-event"
    ]
  },
  "cb-03": {
    "prompt": "How do you define props with validation in a Vue 3 <script setup> component?",
    "explanation": "defineProps is a compiler macro available inside <script setup>. It doesn't need to be imported and allows for runtime validation of the data being passed.",
    "interviewTip": "Prop validation is your first line of defense against bugs in large teams. Always use object syntax for props instead of arrays.",
    "options": [
      "useProps",
      "defineProps",
      "setProps",
      "injectProps"
    ]
  },
  "cb-04": {
    "prompt": "What are 'Fallthrough Attributes' in Vue 3?",
    "explanation": "If a component has a single root element, attributes passed to it (that aren't declared as props) 'fall through' to that root element.",
    "interviewTip": "You can disable this behavior by setting 'inheritAttrs: false' and manually binding attributes using '$attrs'.",
    "options": [
      "Attributes like 'class', 'style', and 'id' passed to a component that are automatically applied to the component's root element.",
      "A bug where props accidentally leak into the global scope.",
      "Variables that bypass the Virtual DOM.",
      "A way to pass props to grandchildren directly."
    ]
  },
  "cb-05": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What is the correct way for the parent to pass a dynamic numeric value to the child?",
    "explanation": "Without the colon (:), '42' is passed as a static string. With the colon (:), it is evaluated as a JavaScript expression, passing it as a number.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a common beginner mistake. Use v-bind (:) for any value that isn't a literal string.",
    "options": [
      "count",
      ":count",
      "v-bind.count",
      "count.number"
    ]
  },
  "cb-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of the following are valid ways to communicate between components that are NOT in a direct parent-child relationship?",
    "explanation": "Provide/Inject is great for 'Prop Drilling' avoidance. Pinia is for global state. Direct mutation of $parent is highly discouraged as it creates tight coupling.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention Provide/Inject as the Vue equivalent to React's Context API.",
    "options": [
      "Provide / Inject (Dependency Injection)",
      "Global State Management (Pinia)",
      "An External Event Bus (using a library like mitt)",
      "Mutating 'this.$parent' directly"
    ]
  },
  "cb-07": {
    "prompt": "What happens if a child emits an event but the parent is not listening for it?",
    "explanation": "Unlike DOM events, Vue's custom events do not bubble by default. If no listener is present on the immediate parent, the event is simply lost.",
    "interviewTip": "This is why debugging missing events usually starts with checking the event name spelling in the @listener.",
    "options": [
      "Vue will throw a runtime error.",
      "The event is ignored, and nothing happens.",
      "The event bubbles up to the 'window' object.",
      "The app crashes."
    ]
  },
  "cb-08": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. Why is 'defineEmits' used here?",
    "explanation": "Using defineEmits makes your component's 'contract' explicit, helping developers (and IDEs) understand how to interact with it.",
    "interviewTip": "In TypeScript, you can even define the types of the arguments passed with the event using defineEmits<{ (e: 'change', id: number): void }>.",
    "options": [
      "To register the component in the global scope.",
      "To provide type-safety and documentation for the events this component can fire.",
      "To allow the component to receive data from the parent.",
      "To style the component buttons."
    ]
  },
  "cb-09": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when rendering lists in Vue?",
    "explanation": "Keys give Vue a hint about the identity of each node. Without keys, Vue uses an algorithm that minimizes element movement but can cause issues with stateful components or transitions.",
    "interviewTip": "Always use unique, stable keys (like IDs) rather than array indexes for dynamic lists.",
    "options": [
      "To encrypt the component data.",
      "To help Vue identify which items have changed, been added, or removed for efficient DOM updates.",
      "To set the component ID.",
      "To improve CSS styling."
    ]
  },
  "cb-10": {
    "prompt": "How do you emit a custom event from a child component to its parent in Vue 3?",
    "explanation": "In <script setup>, you use defineEmits to declare events, then call emit with the event name and optional payload.",
    "interviewTip": "Vue 3 encourages explicit event declarations for better type safety and documentation.",
    "options": [
      "'update'",
      "\"update\", newValue",
      "update",
      "$emit(\"update\")"
    ]
