  "vca-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the main technical difference between 'ref' and 'reactive' in Vue 3?",
    "explanation": "ref wraps any value in an object with a .value property. reactive uses Proxies directly on an object and does not work with primitives like strings or booleans.",
    "interviewTip": "When in doubt, use 'ref'. It is more consistent and makes it clear when you are dealing with reactive data versus plain variables."
  },
  "vca-02": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What will happen to reactivity when 'user' is destructured?",
    "explanation": "Destructuring a reactive object is like copying a property. To preserve reactivity while destructuring, you must use 'toRefs(user)'.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a frequent interview question. Use 'toRefs' or 'toRef' to safely unpack reactive objects into individual refs."
  },
  "vca-03": {
    "prompt": "Which compiler macro is used in <script setup> to make components, props, and variables automatically available to the template?",
    "explanation": "<script setup> is a compile-time transform that simplifies the Composition API by removing the need to manually return everything from a setup() function.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that <script setup> leads to better runtime performance and smaller code bundles."
  },
  "vca-04": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. How should you update the value of a 'ref' in the script block?",
    "explanation": "In the script block, you must access the '.value' property to read or write to a ref. In the template, Vue automatically unwraps it for you.",
    "interviewTip": "Losing the '.value' is the #1 bug for developers moving from Options API to Composition API."
  },
  "vca-05": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'shallowRef()' function?",
    "explanation": "shallowRef is a performance optimization. It's useful when you have large objects or third-party library instances where you only care about replacing the entire object, not tracking every single nested key.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention this when asked how to optimize performance for large datasets that don't need deep reactivity."
  },
  "vca-06": {
    "prompt": "Which of these are valid reasons to prefer the Composition API over the Options API for large projects?",
    "explanation": "Composition API is designed for scalability. Options API often leads to 'fragmented' code where logic for one feature is scattered across data, computed, and methods.",
    "interviewTip": "A great keyword to use is 'Logical Concerns'—Composition API groups code by what it *does*, not what it *is*."
  },
  "vca-07": {
    "prompt": "How do you provide a default value to props when using 'defineProps' in <script setup> with TypeScript?",
    "explanation": "When using type-only declarations in defineProps, you use the 'withDefaults' compiler macro to set default values.",
    "interviewTip": "This is the most 'professional' way to handle props in a TypeScript-based Vue 3 project."
  },
  "vca-08": {
    "prompt": "What does 'unref()' do?",
    "explanation": "unref is a utility for writing flexible functions. It's shorthand for: `isRef(val) ? val.value : val`.",
    "interviewTip": "This is very useful inside 'Composables' where an input might be a ref or a plain value."
  },
  "vca-09": {
    "prompt": "How do you provide and inject dependencies in the Composition API?",
    "explanation": "provide() and inject() allow you to pass data down the component tree without props. This is Vue's dependency injection system.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that inject() can take a default value as a second argument, and that provided values are not reactive unless you explicitly make them so."
  },
  "vca-10": {
    "prompt": "What is 'effectScope()' used for in Vue 3?",
    "explanation": "effectScope() is an advanced API that allows you to manually control when effects (watchers, computed, etc.) are created and destroyed. This is useful for plugin authors and advanced composables.",
    "interviewTip": "Mentioning effectScope shows deep knowledge of Vue's reactivity system and is rarely asked in junior interviews."
