  "hf-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the mandatory first step before accessing any hardware feature like the Camera or Location in a production app?",
    "explanation": "Modern OS (iOS and Android) require apps to explicitly ask the user for permission. Attempting to use a sensor without permission will cause a crash or a silent fail.",
    "interviewTip": "Distinguish between 'Ask once' and 'Always allowed' permissions, especially for Location."
  },
  "hf-02": {
    "prompt": "In Expo, which library is the standard for accessing the device's camera?",
    "explanation": "expo-camera provides a high-level component that handles the viewfinder, taking photos, and recording videos.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that for highly advanced needs (like frame processors for AI), 'react-native-vision-camera' is often used in the CLI workflow."
  },
  "hf-03": {
    "prompt": "How do you handle the difference between 'Foreground' and 'Background' location permissions on Android?",
    "explanation": "To protect privacy, Android 10+ requires users to specifically grant 'Allow all the time' for background access.",
    "interviewTip": "Always follow the 'Principle of Least Privilege'—only ask for background access if it is critical to the app's core function."
  },
  "hf-04": {
    "prompt": "Which library is used to implement FaceID or Fingerprint authentication in React Native?",
    "explanation": "expo-local-authentication (and react-native-local-auth for CLI) provides a unified API to trigger the device's native biometric prompt.",
    "interviewTip": "Always check 'hasHardwareAsync()' and 'isEnrolledAsync()' before showing the 'Login with FaceID' button."
  },
  "hf-05": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. What happens if the user denies the permission?",
    "explanation": "To prevent 'permission spamming,' iOS only shows the system dialog once. If the status is 'denied,' you must programmatically link to Settings using 'Linking.openSettings()'.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a critical UX detail for apps that rely on hardware."
  },
  "hf-06": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Geofencing'?",
    "explanation": "Geofencing allows apps to be notified by the OS when the user crosses a coordinate radius, even if the app isn't actively running.",
    "interviewTip": "This is very efficient for battery life compared to constantly polling the user's location."
  },
  "hf-07": {
    "prompt": "Where must you declare the 'reason' for requesting a permission (e.g., CameraUsageDescription) for iOS?",
    "explanation": "iOS requires a 'Purpose String' in the Info.plist. In Expo, you define these in the 'plugins' section of app.json and they are injected into the plist during build.",
    "interviewTip": "If you don't provide a clear, user-friendly reason, Apple will reject your app during review."
  },
  "hf-08": {
    "prompt": "What does the 'Accelerometer' sensor measure?",
    "explanation": "Accelerometers are used for shake detection, step counting, and controlling games by tilting the phone.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that sensors like this produce data at high frequencies, so it's important to use a 'Subscription' model and clean it up in 'useEffect'."
  },
  "hf-09": {
    "prompt": "How do you check if an Android device has a physical 'Back' button or is using gesture navigation?",
    "explanation": "The BackHandler module lets you listen to the hardware back button press and prevent it or customize its behavior.",
    "interviewTip": "This is an Android-only concern; iOS users expect a 'Back' button in the navigation header or a swipe-back gesture."
  },
  "hf-10": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Linking' used for in hardware access?",
    "explanation": "The Linking module is the bridge to other apps. For example, `Linking.openURL('tel:123456')` triggers the native dialer.",
    "interviewTip": "Use 'Linking.canOpenURL' first to ensure the device has a handler for that specific link (like an email client)."
  }
