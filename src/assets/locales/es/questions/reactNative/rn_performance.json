  "perf-01": {
    "prompt": "Which JavaScript engine is now the default for React Native because it provides faster TTI (Time To Interactive) and smaller APK sizes?",
    "explanation": "Hermes is optimized specifically for mobile. It uses Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation to turn JS into bytecode during the build process, rather than at runtime.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that Hermes also helps reduce the 'Memory Footprint' of the app, which is vital for budget Android devices.",
    "options": [
      "V8",
      "JavaScriptCore (JSC)",
      "Hermes",
      "SpiderMonkey"
    ]
  },
  "perf-02": {
    "prompt": "What is 'FlashList' (by Shopify) and why is it often used instead of 'FlatList'?",
    "explanation": "FlatList unmounts off-screen items. FlashList recycles the underlying native views and simply swaps the data, which is much faster for the device to handle.",
    "interviewTip": "FlashList claims to be '5x to 10x faster' than FlatList. It's a great mention for Senior-level performance discussions.",
    "options": [
      "It is a version of FlatList that only works with images.",
      "It is a highly optimized list component that recycles cells (Views) instead of unmounting them, resulting in significantly higher FPS.",
      "It is a list that only renders once and never updates.",
      "It is a paid plugin for React Native."
    ]
  },
  "perf-03": {
    "prompt": "Analyze the code. Why is this list likely to lag during fast scrolling?",
    "explanation": "Functions defined inside the component body are recreated every render. Additionally, heavy logic like 'expensiveFormat' inside renderItem blocks the JS thread during scroll.",
    "interviewTip": "Solution: Move renderItem outside the component or wrap it in 'useCallback', and memoize the expensive formatting.",
    "options": [
      "Because the renderItem is defined inside the component and 'expensiveFormat' runs on every render.",
      "Because FlatList doesn't support Text components.",
      "Because the data prop is too large.",
      "Because 'uri' images are always slow."
    ]
  },
  "perf-04": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions' method?",
    "explanation": "This ensures that a heavy task doesn't steal CPU cycles from an animation, preventing 'jank' or dropped frames.",
    "interviewTip": "This is perfect for fetching data immediately after a screen transition without making the transition feel sluggish.",
    "options": [
      "To speed up the network requests.",
      "To delay long-running tasks (like data processing) until after animations or navigation transitions have finished.",
      "To check if the user is touching the screen.",
      "To restart the JS thread."
    ]
  },
  "perf-05": {
    "prompt": "Which of these tools are commonly used to profile and debug performance in a React Native app?",
    "explanation": "Flipper and React DevTools are standard for JS/Bridge profiling. Xcode Instruments (and Android Studio Profiler) are needed to inspect native memory and CPU usage.",
    "interviewTip": "Flipper is a 'Senior' choice—it allows you to inspect the bridge traffic, layout, and database in one place.",
    "options": [
      "Flipper (with the LeakCanary and Profiler plugins).",
      "React DevTools (Profiler tab).",
      "Xcode Instruments (for iOS native performance).",
      "Chrome Task Manager."
    ]
  },
  "perf-06": {
    "prompt": "How can you detect if your JS thread is being overloaded in a real device?",
    "explanation": "The 'Perf Monitor' overlay shows the frame rate of both threads. If UI is 60 FPS but JS is 10 FPS, your logic is blocking the app.",
    "interviewTip": "JS FPS drops usually mean too many re-renders or heavy computations; UI FPS drops mean your View hierarchy is too deep or complex.",
    "options": [
      "The app will automatically close.",
      "By checking the 'Perf Monitor' in the Developer Menu to see the JS FPS and UI FPS.",
      "The phone will start to get hot.",
      "The internet speed will decrease."
    ]
  },
  "perf-07": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Inline function' optimization in the context of RN performance?",
    "explanation": "An inline arrow function creates a new reference on every render. If the button is wrapped in 'React.memo', it will still re-render because the 'onPress' prop changed reference.",
    "interviewTip": "This is the most common cause of 'Wasted Renders' in large lists.",
    "options": [
      "Using useCallback prevents the child from re-rendering unnecessarily if it is memoized.",
      "Inline functions are faster to write.",
      "Inline functions are automatically optimized by Hermes.",
      "There is no performance difference."
    ]
  },
  "perf-08": {
    "prompt": "Why should you avoid deep nesting of View components?",
    "explanation": "Every layer of nesting adds work for the Yoga layout engine. Flattening your UI structure improves the speed of initial rendering and updates.",
    "interviewTip": "If you have 10 nested Views just for margins/padding, try to combine them into fewer components.",
    "options": [
      "It makes the code harder to read.",
      "It increases the complexity of the Shadow Tree layout calculations (Yoga), slowing down the UI thread.",
      "It limits the number of colors you can use.",
      "It is not allowed in the App Store."
    ]
  },
  "perf-09": {
    "prompt": "What is the benefit of using 'RAM bundles' (Random Access Modules) in React Native?",
    "explanation": "RAM bundles split the JavaScript into indexed modules. The app loads the 'startup' modules first, then loads other modules as they are required during navigation.",
    "interviewTip": "This is particularly useful for large apps with many screens. Mention 'Metro bundler' configuration for enabling this.",
    "options": [
      "They increase the device's RAM capacity.",
      "They allow the app to load JavaScript modules on-demand rather than loading the entire bundle at startup, reducing TTI (Time To Interactive).",
      "They compress images automatically.",
      "They are only available on iOS."
    ]
  },
  "perf-10": {
    "prompt": "How does the New Architecture improve performance compared to the legacy architecture?",
    "explanation": "The New Architecture (JSI + Fabric + Turbo Modules) removes the JSON serialization bottleneck and allows React to communicate directly with native code, enabling features like synchronous layout and priority-based rendering.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that this brings React Native's performance much closer to fully native apps, especially for complex UI interactions.",
    "options": [
      "It uses more memory to cache everything.",
      "It eliminates the asynchronous bridge, uses JSI for synchronous native calls, and enables concurrent rendering with Fabric.",
      "It removes all animations.",
      "It only works on Android."
