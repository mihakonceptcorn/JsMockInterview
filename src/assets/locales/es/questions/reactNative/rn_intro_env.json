  "rn-env-01": {
    "prompt": "What is the primary difference between the 'Bridge' (Old Architecture) and 'JSI' (New Architecture)?",
    "explanation": "The legacy Bridge requires data to be serialized to JSON and sent across an asynchronous queue. JSI (JavaScript Interface) allows JS to hold references to C++ host objects, enabling direct, synchronous calls.",
    "interviewTip": "Mention that JSI is the foundation for the New Architecture (Fabric and TurboModules).",
    "options": [
      "JSI allows synchronous communication between JS and Native, while the Bridge is asynchronous and serialized.",
      "The Bridge is faster because it uses JSON for all data transfer.",
      "JSI requires Expo, while the Bridge works only with React Native CLI.",
      "The Bridge uses Java exclusively, while JSI uses Swift."

  "rn-env-02": {
    "prompt": "Which layout engine does React Native use to calculate positions and sizes of components?",
    "explanation": "Yoga is a cross-platform layout engine developed by Meta that implements Flexbox for native mobile screens.",
    "interviewTip": "Yoga is written in C++ and is what translates your 'flex: 1' styles into actual pixel coordinates on iOS and Android.",
    "options": [
      "WebKit",
      "Gecko",
      "Yoga",
      "Flexbox-Native"
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-03": {
    "prompt": "What does the 'Hermes' engine do for a React Native application?",
    "explanation": "Hermes is a small, lightweight JS engine. It uses bytecode pre-compilation (AOT) to make app launches significantly faster.",
    "interviewTip": "Starting with React Native 0.70, Hermes is the default engine for all new projects.",
    "options": [
      "It manages the connection to the Google Play Store.",
      "It is a JavaScript engine optimized for mobile to improve start-up time and reduce app size.",
      "It handles all image caching and local storage.",
      "It is a UI library that replaces core components."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-04": {
    "prompt": "What will be the result of this code when running in a React Native environment?",
    "explanation": "Core components like View are JavaScript components (usually functions or objects) that act as wrappers for native UI elements.",
    "interviewTip": "In the end, these components tell the native side to render a 'UIView' on iOS or an 'android.view' on Android.",
    "options": [
      "\"string\"",
      "\"function\" (or \"object\" depending on RN version internal implementation)",
      "\"undefined\"",
      "\"native-element\""
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-05": {
    "prompt": "Which of the following are benefits of using 'Expo' over 'React Native CLI'?",
    "explanation": "Expo simplifies development by abstracting away the complex native code, though the CLI is still preferred if you need custom native module modifications that Expo doesn't support.",
    "interviewTip": "Expo is no longer 'just for beginners'; with 'Development Builds,' it is now powerful enough for professional enterprise apps.",
    "options": [
      "Managed workflow: handles native configurations and certificates automatically.",
      "Direct access to modify AppDelegate.m and MainApplication.java without workarounds.",
      "Easier testing on physical devices via the Expo Go app.",
      "EAS (Expo Application Services) for cloud builds and submissions."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-06": {
    "prompt": "What is the 'Metro' bundler in React Native?",
    "explanation": "Metro is similar to Webpack for the web. It resolves dependencies and bundles your code for the mobile environment.",
    "interviewTip": "Metro is what powers Hot Module Replacement (HMR) / Fast Refresh during development.",
    "options": [
      "A tool that compiles Java code into APKs.",
      "The JavaScript bundler that takes all your JS files and combines them into a single bundle for the app.",
      "A debugging tool used to inspect the UI tree.",
      "The part of the architecture that handles push notifications."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-07": {
    "prompt": "In the New Architecture, what replaces the 'UIManager'?",
    "explanation": "Fabric is the new rendering system. It is more efficient because it allows the UI to be updated synchronously and improves interop with host views.",
    "interviewTip": "Fabric is to Rendering what TurboModules are to Native Logic.",
    "options": [
      "TurboModules",
      "Fabric",
      "Hermes",
      "Metro"
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-08": {
    "prompt": "What is the purpose of 'npx react-native run-ios'?",
    "explanation": "This command triggers the build process (via Xcode tools) and pushes the application to the iOS target.",
    "interviewTip": "You must have Xcode installed on a macOS machine for this command to work.",
    "options": [
      "To install dependencies from npm.",
      "To build and launch the iOS application on a simulator or device.",
      "To minify the JavaScript bundle.",
      "To generate a new project from a template."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-09": {
    "prompt": "Identify the three main threads in a standard React Native app (Bridge architecture):",
    "explanation": "The UI thread handles native view rendering; the JS thread runs the logic; and the Shadow thread calculates the layout (Yoga) before sending it to the UI thread.",
    "interviewTip": "If the JS thread is blocked by heavy logic, the UI remains responsive (animations might still work), but user interactions like button clicks won't process.",
    "options": [
      "Main Thread (UI Thread)",
      "Database Thread",
      "JavaScript Thread",
      "Shadow Thread (Layout Thread)"
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-10": {
    "prompt": "What will happen if you run this code in a standard React Native component?",
    "explanation": "React Native does not use the browser's DOM. You must use native primitives like <View> and <Text>.",
    "interviewTip": "There is no 'div', 'span', or 'p' in React Native; everything text-related must be inside a <Text> component.",
    "options": [
      "It works because RN supports all HTML tags.",
      "It throws an error because 'div' is not a valid component in React Native.",
      "It renders as a View automatically.",
      "It only works on the Web version of React Native."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-11": {
    "prompt": "What is 'Autolinking' in React Native?",
    "explanation": "Previously, you had to run 'react-native link'. Now, the CLI detects native modules in your node_modules and links them during build time.",
    "interviewTip": "For iOS, you still need to run 'pod install' after adding a library to finalize the autolinking.",
    "options": [
      "A feature that automatically updates your npm packages.",
      "A mechanism that automatically links native dependencies to your iOS/Android projects without manual steps.",
      "A way to link two different screens in navigation.",
      "An AI tool for writing boilerplate code."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-12": {
    "prompt": "What is the entry point for native configuration in an Android React Native project?",
    "explanation": "The AndroidManifest.xml is where you define permissions, activities, and app metadata for the Android OS.",
    "interviewTip": "Knowing where these native files are (android/app/src/main/...) is essential for configuring things like deep links or camera permissions.",
    "options": [
      "AppDelegate.m",
      "AndroidManifest.xml",
      "index.js",
      "metro.config.js"
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-13": {
    "prompt": "In React Native, how is a 'TurboModule' different from a standard Native Module?",
    "explanation": "Standard modules are initialized on app startup even if not used. TurboModules are only loaded when required and communicate directly via JSI.",
    "interviewTip": "This is a key part of the New Architecture aimed at improving app startup performance.",
    "options": [
      "TurboModules are written in JavaScript, while Native Modules are written in Java.",
      "TurboModules are loaded lazily and use JSI for faster, synchronous communication.",
      "TurboModules only work on iOS.",
      "TurboModules are the old way of writing native code."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-14": {
    "prompt": "What command is used to start the Metro bundler manually?",
    "explanation": "This starts the local server that provides the JS bundle and assets to your running app during development.",
    "interviewTip": "If you get a 'Could not connect to development server' error, checking if this process is running is your first step.",
    "options": [
      "npm build",
      "npx react-native start",
      "npx metro-run",
      "expo-cli build"
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-15": {
    "prompt": "Which of these is a valid way to specify a version of React Native in a project?",
    "explanation": "The React Native version is managed like any other npm package in the package.json file.",
    "interviewTip": "Upgrading React Native versions often requires the 'React Native Upgrade Helper' tool because of changes in the underlying native files.",
    "options": [
      "The code above is correct.",
      "Versions are specified in the 'native-config.json' file.",
      "You set the version in the Xcode project settings only.",
      "React Native versions are managed by the Hermes engine."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-16": {
    "prompt": "What does the 'Shadow Tree' represent?",
    "explanation": "The Shadow Tree is where React Native stores the layout information (flex, margin, padding) so Yoga can work its magic.",
    "interviewTip": "In the New Architecture, the Shadow Tree is immutable and managed in C++ for better performance.",
    "options": [
      "A hidden copy of the DOM.",
      "A tree structure used by Yoga to calculate the layout before translating it to native views.",
      "The list of all deleted components.",
      "A security layer that protects the JS thread."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-17": {
    "prompt": "How do you enable the New Architecture in a modern React Native project (iOS)?",
    "explanation": "For most current versions, you must explicitly enable it during the pod installation process for iOS or in gradle.properties for Android.",
    "interviewTip": "Be aware that some third-party libraries might not be compatible with the New Architecture yet.",
    "options": [
      "Changing a setting in the Expo dashboard.",
      "Running 'bundle exec pod install' with the ENV flag 'RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1'.",
      "It is always enabled and cannot be turned off.",
      "By deleting the Bridge.js file."
    ]
  },
  "rn-env-18": {
    "prompt": "What happens when 'Fast Refresh' is triggered?",
    "explanation": "Fast Refresh combines 'hot reloading' and 'live reloading' to provide a seamless update experience without losing the component's state if possible.",
    "interviewTip": "If you modify a file that exports something other than a React component, Fast Refresh may perform a full reload to be safe.",
    "options": [
      "The whole app reloads and all state is lost.",
      "React Native tries to update only the modified components while preserving their state.",
      "The native code (Java/Swift) is recompiled.",
      "The device vibrates to indicate an update."
